# Chapter Five: Naval Air Station, Ottumwa, Iowa

## The Training Evolution
I would like to say that the previous 9 months at the college Wooster, Ohio, the learning to fly at Mt. Pleasant, and the preflight training at the University of Iowa was not necessary. We could have started at the primary bases learning to fly the bi-plane and accomplished just as much. If I had enlisted a year before I did, all of the training would have been done at N.A.S. Pensacola.

## Learning the Stearman
When we arrived at Ottumwa, they put us in a group of 3 cadets and we stayed together until the end of the training at Ottumwa. My instructors name was Lt. Shea and was really a nice guy, not one of the jerks who thought he was the best pilot in the Navy.

## The Five Training Stages
There were 5 stages you had to go though, A, B, C, D, and E. The first Stage, (A) was to show you the area, the traffic pattern and all the necessary things to get in and out of the field, and more basic flying. Stage B was refining pilot skills. Stage C was acrobatics. During stage C, the cadet received instruction in any maneuvers not necessary to normal flight. Some of the maneuvers were the loop, slow rolls, Immelman turns, and the regular spin, and also the inverted spin.

## Night Flying and Challenges
When I was checked out for night flying, the instructor took you up and showed you what to do. I still remember my instructor, Lt Nielson. On our ride he let me take the controls and would say, start your turn here, do this, do that, but no way was he going to let me do it by myself. I don't blame him, but I still had to do the night flying by myself. The only fatality was during night flying. One of the cadets landed on top of another plane.

## Weather and Operating Conditions
I was at Ottumwa during the winter, so we wore the heavy flying suits and it was difficult to get in the plane with all that gear. It was so cold that we wore face masks. The weather at Ottumwa was very cold, mostly between 10 and 20 above zero. One day, both the landing mats were covered with a sheet of ice that happened while I was in the air. Just as I touched down while landing, a plane beside me did a complete 360 spin on the ice.
