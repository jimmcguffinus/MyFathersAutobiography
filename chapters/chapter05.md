# Chapter Five: Naval Air Station, Ottumwa, Iowa

I would like to say that the previous 9 months at the college Wooster, Ohio, the learning to fly at Mt. Pleasant, and the preflight training at the University of Iowa was not necessary. We could have started at the primary bases learning to fly the bi-plane and accomplished just as much. If I had enlisted a year before I did, all of the training would have been done at N.A.S. Pensacola.

At Pensacola, you trained at the main original base and went through about 5 stages and were then designated a naval aviator. You didn’t travel all over the country to different bases which represented the same training done at Pensacola. The maximum time to finish was about 12 months. At Pensacola you started out flying the bi-plane Stearman or the N3N bi-plane made at the Naval Aircraft Factory. The N-3N was a lot like the Stearman, but was an older plane. That plane was also used as a float plane. The cadets at Pensacola had to qualify as a seaplane pilot, which was not required in my training. I wish I had gone through some of that training.

When we arrived at Ottumwa, they put us in a group of 3 cadets and we stayed together until the end of the training at Ottumwa. I can’t remember the names of the other two in my group. Being in a group made it more interesting to see how each one of us did, and we chummed around together. My instructors name was Lt. Shea and was really a nice guy, not one of the jerks who thought he was the best pilot in the Navy.

They assigned us to a barracks and there were double-decker beds. The guy next to me wet the bed every night. They had to have the lower bunk and the mattress was straw. I can’t believe the navy would put up with that.

The air station was located in the country and was surrounded by corn fields. If you were going to make a forced landing, the corn field would be a good place to land, if you couldn’t find an open field. The air base had two landing or takeoff fields and they were huge mats. The tower was located in the center of the two fields. You would take off on one of the fields and land on the other. That would not be the same every day. Sometimes you would have a right-hand landing pattern, and sometimes a left-hand pattern. You would look at the light in the center of tower, if it was green, it would be a left-hand pattern and red for a right. The way I remembered it was red started with an R which meant right hand.

When you came in for a landing, you did not follow in tandem. You landed with planes on the right side and left side. There could be six or seven planes landing side by side, and you had to really watch out for a crash. The 3 months I was there, I can’t remember an accident in the traffic pattern, except one at night and that was the only fatality in the 3 months, pretty good record. That was not to happen in the future.

My first flight was very interesting. One of the cadets told me to wiggly the stick and he makes a motion like I would like to have him do some acrobatics. That is what I did and before you knew it, I was on my back and the gosport tubes and I was hanging from the seat belt and then he did loops, slow rolls, spins and all of tricks he knew. They loved to take people up and try to make them get sick, especially the waves. Because I already knew how to fly somewhat, it only took about 2 hours, and I was going up alone. That was a pretty good feeling.

There were 5 stages you had to go though, A, B, C, D, and E. The first Stage, (A) was to show you the area, the traffic pattern and all the necessary things to get in and out of the field, and more basic flying. This didn’t take long. The average flight time to solo was about 10 hours. Most of the cadet came to primary straight from pre-flight school and they had no flight time at all. I believe my group was the first to arrive from WTS where we learned to fly the piper cub, so one flight and we soled. The Stearman’s we flew were N2S-3 and had 7 cylinder engines and were painted yellow. Some people called them the yellow pearl, but that was not true. The plane called the yellow pearl was the N3N make by the naval aircraft factory which dated back to ww1.

Other things you did in stage A were learning the flying rules and air discipline, ground indoctrination, instruction in take-offs and landings, taxing, and stalls and spins. One of the rules was if the temperature was below 10 degrees we would not have to fly. Stage B was refining pilot skills. He received instruction in steeply banked turns, precision landings, wing-over’s, and emergency landings. He also learned S-turns to circles or slips to a landing, banking against the wind to control landing of the plane. Most of the stage B took place over auxiliary fields located within a twenty-mile radius of the naval air station. When giving check rides for these maneuvers, check pilots always observed students from the ground.

Stage C was acrobatics. During stage C, the cadet received instruction in any maneuvers not necessary to normal flight. Some of the maneuvers were the loop, slow rolls, Immelman turns, and the regular spin, and also the inverted spin. The difference between the regular spin and the inverted spin was, the regular spin, the gravity was pushing you toward the seat and reverse for the inverted spin. If you didn’t have your seat belt on during the inverted spin, you would be shot right out of the airplane. Other maneuvers were the snap roll, the split S, and the falling leaf.

When I was trying to qualify for the landings in a 200-foot circle, both straight and also during an S turn, my instructor told me how I could cheat by coming in like you were going to be short of the circle and just before you got to the circle you added just a touch of the throttle, not enough for the check instructor on the ground to notice. One of the things the check instructor told us was if you were short the first try, you better be long on the next one. I made all kinds of landings, some in the circle and most of them outside of the circle.

We knew if we passed we would be going into stage D and E, which was mostly formation flying in a flight of 3. Up till then, you were flying from the back seat. After you landed at the end of your circle landings, the instructor would talk to you on the ground. The indication that you passed the test was when you got in the plane to go back to the main field, and the instructor got in the back seat and you in the front, which meant you were qualified for formation flying. My instructor got up on the plane and was putting his leg in the front seat, which was not good. As he did this, he stopped half way, turned to me and said, get in the front seat. What a relief. Flying the Stearman from the front seat was really good, as you could see the front wheels, which make the landing easier.

On one of my check rides, I took off and performed the necessary things without a word from the instructor for the entire hour. When we landed he gave me a down which was flunking and said I left the traffic pattern at the wrong altitude. I was supposed to leave at 300 feet, as the incoming traffic was coming in the traffic pattern at 800 feet. When you got a down you had to fly two check rides and pass both of them or you were out. I was correct in my altitude, but there was no chance to protest. I passed both check rides o.k. and my main instructor said I got the best mark from one of the toughest check instructors.

My instructor Lt. Shea took all 3 of us to his apartment for dinner, and I noticed he had a beautiful wife. The primary course was also called the elimination base because this is where they determined if you were qualified to go on further in your training. Also, this is where they decided what kind of pilot your were going to be, Dive Bomber, Sea plane pilot, Torpedo bomber pilot, multi-engine pilot, fighter pilot, or observation.

Another very dumb thing that I did was when we were going to take our test for recognition. I knew all the airplanes very good. The test consisted of viewing 40 airplanes on a screen showing one at a time at a 1/75 of a second. One of the cadets got a copy of the test in advance and passed the answers to all of us, which were at least 30 cadets. When they started the test, we compared the views with our cheat sheet, and if they were correct, and we turned in our prepared test. We were almost graduating and the ones who got the best score were going to get 3 extra days leave. They never found out about what we did, and I did get 3 extra days leave. If we were caught, we would have been kicked out of the program. Cheating was a very dumb thing to do. I still don’t like to think about it, as I didn’t have to do that to pass. They should have caught us as it would look suspicious, 30 cadets getting a perfect score. I guess when you are young you get caught up into things like that.

When I was checked out for night flying, the instructor took you up and showed you what to do. I still remember my instructor, Lt Nielson. On our ride he let me take the controls and would say, start your turn here, do this, do that, but no way was he going to let me do it by myself. I don’t blame him, but I still had to do the night flying by myself. The only fatality was during night flying. One of the cadets landed on top of another plane.

My instructor and I were coming back from
Okay, continuing with the next chunk of Markdown output, picking up directly from the previous completion:

one of my day time flights when my instructor got into a dog fight with another instructor and his cadet. We were flying at about a thousand feet. They went round and round and I never felt so many “G” forces. Some of the instructors thought they were pretty good. The instructors were upset, not being able to go further in the program and to combat. The instructors usually were civilian pilots who went through an accelerated instructor courses.

I was told that some of the cadets would chase the trains and try to touch the top of the engine with one of their wheels. You know there would be a cadet that would try that.

One of my friends was doing some acrobatics, a slow roll. You had to pull back on the stick very fast, push to the right, or left, and then neutralize the controls. When you did one to the left, your arm would go across the lever to unhook your seat belt. My friend Ray Lynch did this and his seat belt came loose and he ended out of the plane lying on top of the fuselage. He dove back in head first into the cockpit and from then on he wired the belt so they wouldn’t come loose. There were a number of guys who fell out of the plane and were saved by the parachute. You were supposed to hang on the part you pulled to open the chute.

One of my flights was to learn to do slow rolls. My instructor told me all you had to do was push the sick to the left or right; half way around you would push the sick forward to keep the plane level. We did this to the right for a half hour and coming back to the base to the left for the other half hour. That seemed easy enough, but later on in my training I found out I was doing barrel rolls instead of a slow roll. A slow roll you used all of the controls, including the rudders which would keep the plane in straight line, much more difficult than the slow roll. I guess my instructor thought it was too difficult and took the easy way out.

Most of the cadets went through the whole program with out any trouble, but I seemed to run into trouble all of the time. When I was going through primary, there was still a need for naval aviators, but later on, I heard because the war was coming to a close, the wash out got as high as 50%. I read an article by Ted Williams who became an instructor after his training at Pensacola and they told him to wash out more cadets. His reply was if they are good pilots, he would not wash them out. Ted Williams was training at Pensacola the same time that I was. There are a couple of stories I will tell later.

I was at Ottumwa during the winter, so we wore the heavy flying suits and it was difficult to get in the plane with all that gear. It was so cold that we wore face masks.

The farmers complained that the cadet would try to take the tops of the corn off by flat-hatting, or flying low. There were stories of instructors and the cadet making forced landings in a corn field and could not take off, so they would taxi back and forth cutting the corn down to make a runway and then take off and return to base.

Another thing the cadets did was flying over the Mississippi river upside down. The engine would cut out while you flew upside down, but as soon as you turned the plane right side up, the engine would start again. During the months I was there, there were a total of 800 cadets, which would mean that at least 70 cadets would leave to go to Pensacola, Jacksonville, Miami, or Corpus Christi every week. Multiply that by all the other primary bases and there were hundreds going for advance training. I heard a figure of 25,000 naval aviators graduated from Pensacola by the end of the war including the very first who graduated in 1914.at Pensacola Before the war. Pensacola was the only place to become a naval aviator then.

The weather at Ottumwa was very cold, mostly between 10 and 20 above zero. One day, both the landing mats were covered with a sheet of ice that happened while I was in the air. Just as I touched down while landing, a plane beside me did a complete 360 spin on the ice. It was no trouble for either of us as we just kept going straight till we slowed down.

When I first arrived at Ottumwa, the planes were colored yellow. This color is the reason they were called the yellow peril. The speed we cruised at was about 90 knots and we would climb and glide at 65 knots. Because of the construction of the plane, you could do any kind of acrobatics and you would not have to worry about the wings coming off. One of the most strenuous was the progressive spin. You started out by pulling the nose straight up, letting the plane go into a spin. Just after you entered the spin you started to recover, but before you did, you hit opposite rudder and pulled back on the stick which would make you go into a spin in the opposite direction. You did this 3 of 4 times before you finally came out of the spin. The “G” force was tremendous.
