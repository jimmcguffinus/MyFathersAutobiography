# Chapter Twelve: Carrier Deployment

## Joining USS Hornet
Our squadron was assigned to the USS Hornet (CV-12), one of the newest Essex-class carriers in the fleet. The ship had already established a distinguished combat record in the Pacific, and we were proud to become part of her history.

## Life at Sea
Adapting to carrier life was a new challenge. The constant motion of the ship, the cramped quarters, and the strict routines took some getting used to. But the sense of purpose and camaraderie among the squadron made it bearable.

## Combat Air Patrols
Our primary mission was flying Combat Air Patrols (CAPs) to protect the carrier group from enemy aircraft. Hours of monotonous patrol flying could suddenly turn into intense moments of action if enemy aircraft were spotted.

## Strike Missions
When not flying CAP, we conducted strike missions against enemy positions. These required precise coordination between multiple aircraft types - fighters, dive bombers, and torpedo planes. Each mission was carefully planned and briefed.

## The Reality of War
The reality of war became clear as we witnessed combat losses and heard reports from other squadrons. The veterans in our group reminded us that overconfidence could be fatal, and that respect for the enemy was essential for survival.
