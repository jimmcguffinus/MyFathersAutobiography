# Chapter Eleven: Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida

After graduation, they sent us to the train station that was downtown Pensacola, where it was located from the beginning. From now on, every time we traveled we would have our orders given to us in a folder with at least 26 copies. Every time you went to a different place, you had to give the Navy a copy of the orders. I have a copy of most of them are in my file.

The trip to N.A.S. Station Jacksonville was a short trip. As far as I know, I was the only one of the 300 who graduated on the 28th of July 1944 at Pensacola to go to NAS Jacksonville. Where the rest of them went I did not know. There were Naval Air Stations at Daytona Beach, Melbourne, Vero Beach, and Miami. The NAS at Miami dates to ww1 and trained Naval Aviator for ww1 and also for Airships called lighter than air. Gerald Nichols went to Daytona Beach to fly the F6F Hellcat and was there the same time I was at Jacksonville. The other bases were for the SBD dive bombers and the TBF torpedo bombers. The ones who went to those bases were picked long before they graduated as I was at Barin field.

You can’t imagine how many airplanes were flying around those bases. The traffic pattern was as dangerous as you could get. The distance from Pensacola to Jacksonville was about 350 miles and would only take a day to get there by train. Traveling on the train was a lot of fun. When you boarded the train, you grabbed any seat that was available. If you had some friends you could arrange the seats so they were facing each other, that way you could have 4 people to set with, or leave the one seat facing forward, Which ever you would want. Because the trains were coal burners, you always had smoke coming in the windows if it were summer time. It sure seemed different and good to be traveling as an officer and as a single person and not in a group, that way you could do what and when you wanted to.

When I arrived at Jacksonville, I went straight to the Naval Air Station and checked in with the duty officer and gave them one of the many orders that I had. They assigned me to one of the officer’s quarters and I was put in a room with one other officer. From now on I did not have to make my bed or muster in a group like as a cadet. We had Black maids who took care of all the cleaning of the building and the rooms. I reported to the administration building to find out what I was going to do and they told me to wait and they would notify me when I was going to start flying. This was about the first of August 1944. From that time until the 30th of august I just sat around and waited for them to notify me.

The Naval Air Station was located on the St Johns River which was about 10 miles from the Atlantic ocean shore, and was on the east side of the river. The base was one of the largest bases in the United States and is at the present time. It was also a few miles south of downtown Jacksonville. Most of the time you took off going west and by the time you were air born you would be going over the St Johns River. The base did not have a lot of athletic provisions, but it did have a very nice pool, not far from our quarters.

I was finally notified that we were going to start flying and they put me in a group of 8 pilots. They were Lt. Richard T. Schaeffer who was our leader and a graduate of the Naval Academy, Lt. Vincent A. Dahlstrom who just came back from combat in the Pacific flying F6F Hellcats and he use to tell us he could cut a large tree down firing his 50 cal. machine guns. He also dressed fancy with high fur lined boots, Lt. Gordon and I didn’t know where he came from; These officers were 27 or 28 years old at that time and had quite a lot of experience. They did not really have to take this training, but I believe they were there to help the rest of us who were brand new. The others were Lt. j.g. Robert P. Brewer who came from Pensacola where he was in instructor and was also 28 years old, Ensign Joseph B. Laduke who was from Flat Rock Michigan, Ensign Percy L. Liles who was from California, Ensign Peter Kantralis who was a Greek, and of course me, Ensign Robert E. McGaffin

. I wish there had been a picture of us as a group but that did not happen. Most of the groups did have there picture taken. The first thing we did was to have training classes to learn all about the F4U Corsair and to learn about the base and the traffic pattern and the area. They set up a mock cockpit of the corsair and we had to learn the instrument panel and we would have a test blind folded, so we knew it very well.

The Corsair did not have an electrical start. We had to use a Kaufman Cartridge which was put in a firing position at the right side of the engine, like a shotgun rifle. When you pressed the starter, the cartridge would fire and turn the prop a few times and you would hope to start the engine that way. Most of the time it took more than one cartridge to start the engine. The planes we were to fly were mostly back from combat and were in the worst of shape. All of them were of the canopy bird cage type. It wasn’t till later that they came out with ignition start and a bubble canopy. We had the same planes all through our training at Jacksonville.

One of the mechanics was a sailor named Al Vandemullen who was on the tennis team at Flint Central High School with me. He had been washed out as a cadet so ended up NAS Jacksonville as a mechanic. He told me he wouldn’t fly those planes for anything because they were in such bad shape. He was transferred to the Carrier, the USS Intrepid and was standing on the deck when a Japanese Kamikaze hit where he was standing and he was killed. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Al had a car in high school and we use to drive it all over the place. In those days a lot of kids had a car.

I was 20 years old at this time. Percy Liles was 22 and Pete Kantralis and Joe Laduke were also 22 years old, leaving me as the youngest.

On my solo flight I was given instruction to taxi the plane around the field for a few minutes and then take off. This was all done with the women waves in the tower giving us instructions, as they had seen this done many times. I had the sequence all figured out. Everything was set in the plane. I had the engine fixed at full mixture, full R.P.M. etc. As soon as you left the ground, you pulled the throttle back to the proper setting for climb and adjusted the mixture to a more a lean position. I guess I was in shock because of so much power on take off I forget to adjust the power and R.P.M. control, and finally the wave in the tower said “O.K. you can pull the throttle back anytime in a sarcastic voice and that woke me up and I continued on fine. When I got to my cruising altitude, I could not believe the power the plane had and the big long nose was something else. It was some change from the 650 H.P. SNJ to this 2000 H.P. Pratt and Whitney engine. Now came the time for my landing.

The runway I had to land on had a telephone line at the front of the landing strip. I make a nice approach and was about to touch my wheels down when the wave in the tower told me to go around, so I added throttle and went around. The radio was not working well and I could hardly hear. The second approach I was about to touch my wheels down when I heard the same thing from the tower. I went around again and finally the wave told me my canopy was not open. I don’t know why she made me go around as I was just about down both times, but everything worked out o.k. That was a solo to remember.

The type of plane I soled was an F3A-1 Corsair built by Brewster Corp. There were a total of 12,000 corsairs built and only 700 by Brewster. The reason for that was the Navy thought Brewster Corp. was doing an inferior job. Of the 700 that Brewster built, 300 went to the British, so it was quite rare to fly one of these. They were the bird cage canopy type. The serial no. of the plane I soled was 04618 which were only 300 off the assembly line. I could not believe I was flying a powerful airplane like the Corsair.

The call name for the air station was Blue base and the call name for our group of 8 was Bingo 264. The number may be wrong, but like that. There were so many airplanes there that there was a landing or take off every 2 minutes for the entire war, from 1942 to 1945. We always flew in a flight of 8 like all the other groups. When you were approaching the field you would call the tower asking for landing instructions, and mostly they would tell us to orbit at 3,000 feet. There would be groups of 8 in a complete circle, like flying formation with each group. Finally they would clear us to the 2,000 foot level, and then to the 1,000 foot level and finally clear us to land. Why there were not more collisions I don’t know.

The planes we flew were parked in the same spot all the time and we would meet every day at the time we were supposed to go up. From my barracks to the planes was only a few hundreds yards. The first time out group went up was on the 30th of August, 1944. We would taxi behind each other and zig zag back and forth so we could see so we would not run into each other, which was a good idea. At the end of the runway we would stop, rev out motor as fast as it would go with out going up on its nose and check the magnetos both left and right. The R.P.M. was supposed to drop less than 100 for each magneto. If this was O.K. we each took off and joined up as fast as we could in formation. I forgot who I flew on, and it was not the same person each day. My total hours in flight at that time were about 273 hours. Not much to be flying a high powered plane like the Corsair, Less than J.F.K.

During the first flight I stayed back from the guy I was flying on to far and got my ass reamed out about that. As I said before, we did not have enough meetings to find out some of these facts. We learned the hard way. For the first 7 flights we would do familiarization and practice flying formation, learning to join up in formation, coming in to the field and breaking off one at a time to land. For the next 14 months until the end of the war we would be flying in an 8 plane formation and it was not long before we got pretty good at it.

Every time we went up, it seemed like there was a mayday, meaning someone was going down, mostly from engine trouble. The rules were we were supposed to keep off the radio so the accidents could be report to the air station. That would never happen as usually someone would yell, shut up your god damn mouth. The waves who ran the tower would also get into it. As the years went by, someone would find one of the planes in the swamp or somewhere. I can tell you where there are a couple of planes today, in the water. When the planes got to old, they would take them on a barge out to sea and dump them. the navy would love to find them today. I am sure some of them would be the rare F3A-1 Brewster planes.

From time to time we would go up in an SNJ trainer to get more instruction in instrument flying. This would happen to keep up in good shape in case of an emergency, and later on this training that would save my life. They would put us under a hood so we could not see and give us the works. After while it got fairly easy. By watching the altitude, the air speed, and the direction you were going kept you from getting into trouble. If you were careless and lost your orientation, it would be difficult to recover and that is what happened to J.F.K. Once you were in trouble, they teach us to recover. One of the things they would do is, the instructor would fly the plane all over the sky, loops, dives, and steep banks, and all this under the hood with only the instrument panel to look at, and sometime during this he would ask you to recover. You could be on you back, or in any position. I know I would never be an instructor doing this and trust someone to recover, no, no. In fact I would not be an instructor. When the instructor was flying the plane all over the sky, you would be watching the instrument panel to see if the plane was going down or up. If it were going down the airspeed would be fast, then as it was going up the airspeed would start to decrease. The large hand on the altitude gage would be going around so fast; you had to decide real quickly whether you were going up or down. As you were going down your wings may not be level, or in a steep diving turn. If you were in a steep diving turn and he asked you to recover, you would have to level your wings first, before you pulled out, other wise you would go into a suicide dive, like J.F.K. did. Because of this training we became better trained then the Army pilot who I know did not get this training. Many pilots lost there lives because they did not know these things, especially civilian life.

I had 8 instruments flights while at NAS Jacksonville, so you see how important this was, besides the instrument course at NAS Pensacola. Ensign Joe Emmett became lost while flying alone and had to land at an auxiliary field overnight and while coming back, he slightly hit a tree and ripped the flaps off his plane while landing. While flying formation, Joe LaDuke would be looking inside the cockpit to much and we would pull away and he would wonder where we went. When he looked up nobody would be there. He took that fooling around pretty good. Another time, while on a gunnery run he passed out, but recovered before he hit the water. He had no idea why that happened. Maybe he blacked out but most of the time it would only be the lost of your vision and to much “G” force.

Of the 8 pilots, Lt Robert Brewer, Ensign Joe Laduke and I stayed together until the end of the war.

The next 6 flights were tactical flights and could be anything from simulated carrier landings, practicing combat or just flying around. One of the flights was a high altitude flight to about 40,000 feet to test our oxygen equipment. When you at that height, you would be going a lot faster than the indicated speed on the instrument panel. If your indicated speed on your gage was 200, you would really be going about 400 miles per hour ground speed. You could really tell by the some of wind going by the plane and you could not turn to sharp, or you would stall out because of the rare atmosphere, or thin air.

We had to practice what they called field carrier landings which would be at an auxiliary field where a landing field officer would be to bring us in. We would fly over the field and break off to get an interval and take our turn’s one at a time. We would do this for at least 8 landings. As soon as we hit the runway we would add throttle and go around for the next landing. The landing signal officer would tell you whether you were going to fast or to slow. Also he would give you the signal to high or to low. You had to trust and obey his signals or you would be in trouble. They were the boss and they had the authority to tell anyone off including Admirals, and they did. On a carrier, if you were not doing to good, they could ground you. On one of my approaches the signal officer gave me a slow signal to late and I stalled out and was headed right for him. He dropped his signal flags and took off running. I hit on my left wheel, bounced in the air. Added throttle and kept on going. We would meet with him back at the base and he would chew out who ever needed it and discuss the landings with us. He never mentioned that I made him drop his paddles. He knew it was his fault.

The reason we would practice carrier landings was for our next Assignment at NAS Glenview just north of Chicago and we had to make 8 landings on one of the two carriers operating there to qualify.

Combat or dog fighting was part of the tactical stage and we took turns with each of us to try and see who the best was. One of my combats was with Lt. Richard Schaefer, our leader. The rules were that we were not allowed to touch the throttle. We set it at 22 inches of mercury and left it there. The start was the same as at Pensacola. One had the advantage of 1,000 feet and going head on and when we were over and under each other that was the signal to go. We finally got down to the same altitude going head on and then in a circle opposite each other. We tried all the tricks, like putting your landing gear down. Going around the circle I would stall out and recover, stall out again and recover. The slower you went the more sharply you could turn. We finished with a draw and when we got back to the base. He accused me of adding throttle, and maybe he did. How could you tell from another plane?

I had another combat with Ensign Pete Kantralis and we went round and round and finally he got on my tail, so I did a split “S” and after recovering I noticed the fabric was coming off my wing. These planes were so old and bad shape that anything could happen. The wings were fabric covered aft of the leading spar. I radioed him and told him I was going back to the base. The unwritten rule was to never leave some one alone. He should have followed me back. He said he was going to fool around, so I went back to the base. Later on about 7 O’clock at night. Schaefer, our commander asks me if I knew where Pete was. I told him I didn’t know and the last time I saw him was over the coast line after we had our combat. What h A farmer said he saw a plane going straight down about 3 miles off shore. Pete said he was going to make a career of the navy and I guess he did. He was 22 years old. Every new base we went to, we had to fill out a form and name who you wanted to escort your body where it was to be buried. Pete had named Ensign Joe LeDuke and the place of internment was Arlington cemetery. It was about one month before the navy said they found his body, and Joe escorted him to Washington for burial. I have never believed they found his body. How could you find an airplane 3 miles off shore and how would you get to it I think the sent an empty coffin to Arlington cemetery.

I use to go into downtown Jacksonville on a bus once in a while and also to Jacksonville Beach which was about 10 miles. There was a restaurant called Barney’s restaurant, bar and cocktail lounge and they advertised to come and dine with the man in green. They had a picture of a man in green and a dog in their advertising and pictured in the restaurant. Right across the street was a very nice theater with a large marquee, which I went to once in a while. Jacksonville was a very nice looking downtown. I wonder what it looks like now.

I only went up night flying 4 times and that was enough for me. There were very tall tapered lights along the runway, and this was very old fashion and was to disappear from all the bases and civilian fields also I would say the lights were at least 3 or 4 foot high. On my take off, was a little careless. There was a cross wing and I drifted to the right and as I was becoming airborne, I felt a jar on my right landing gear. At that time I didn’t know what it was. The navy would station someone at the end of the runway and check to see if your landing gear came up o.k. Just after take off before I left the field, they called me and said one of my landing gear was not retracted. I put the landing gear down and then up and everything worked well. Then I realized that I may have hit one of the lights. Also I though I might have a flat tire and was going to see if they could check as I was landing, but that was stupid. How could they tell from the ground? As it turned out, I forgot all about it and just after I touched down in my landing, I knew I had a flat tire. Just after touch down the plane swerved shortly to one side, I was afraid it was going to tip over. The plane started to go off the runway and was starting to do a 180 turn. As this was happening I kept pumping the opposite break from the direction I was going. The last 100 yards I was going backwards and finally stopped. If I had hit the light lower on take off me could have demolished the plane and me. I lucked out a number of times. What is interesting is you could do anything like that and the Navy would not do anything about it, in fact, no one ever said any thing to me about it.

I was flying at night and not paying any attention about conserving gas. I must have been up about 2 hours when the engine conked out and I was right over the heart of Jacksonville, downtown about 1,000 feet high. I put the nose down to pick up speed and I knew I was to low to bail out and besides it was a bad area to have a plane crash. The gas tank held 240 gallons of gas, but when you got down to 5o gallons a red light would go on under the gas gage. When this happened you would have to change the indicator to be able to get to the last 50 gallons which was not much for a 2,000 horse power engine. That’s when my brain kicked into over drive. I had the canopy opened and was thinking about jumping out when I thought of the 5o gallon reserve and reached down and changed the lever for the gas tank. Wow, the engine caught and my heart started beating normal. It wasn’t long before I was in the traffic pattern and landed. That was the 2nd night flight of the 4.

The 3rd time I was up doing the same thing, when a RAF pilot joined up on my wing. There was a lot of RAF pilot training to fly the corsair. I tried to make him leave, but he stayed with me like he was afraid to be alone. There were a few clouds about, so I went into one of the clouds and did a quick turn and lost him. The RAF pilots were not to smart and would get the business form all of us.

I was flying down the coast for what reason, I can’t remember when fumes started to come into my cockpit and it was difficult to breath. I open the canopy but the fumes still kept coming in. I was worried about the plane catching fire and I happened to be right above the field at the NAS Mayport which was right on the coast. I did a spit “S” and dove straight down; called the tower at Mayport and they gave me landing instruction. I wasn’t only a few minutes from the start of the fumes to when I landed. I taxied to the flight line and went to the offices at the flight line and told them my trouble. The said I would have to stay over night while they looked at the plane. Seems like there was always something happening to me. In the morning they told me it was a hydraulic leak and it was a good thing I got down as quick as I did for soon I would not have gotten my landing gear down unless I used the system that would allow me to put the gear down only once. I flew back to the base at Jacksonville which was only about 15 minutes away. Every time we went on a gunnery hop, we would meet above the field at NAS Ma port and it is a major station today.

Two other things happened that was not too good and very sad. If you were afraid of flying, you could go the superintendent and ask to get out of flying. Most of the time they would go along with it. You would have to see the psychiatrist. One of the guys wanted to do this, but they talked him into sticking to it a while longer. That was a big mistake. When you feel like that they should let you go right away. This guy was coming in for a landing and lost it, crashed and burned up. The only thing they found was his dog tags. A flyer by the name of Bell was a dare devil. He would take any one on playing chicken. That was when you and the other guy would fly towards each other and the first one to pull away was chicken. He liked to smoke in the cockpit and everyone tried to tell him that was not a good idea. If you had fumes in the cockpit, the plane could explode. This happened to him. His plane blew into many pieces and him to.

Ensign Joe LeDuke had a difficult time keeping roommates. I think he lost 3 roommates before thee war ended. His roommate at NAS Jacksonville was taking off and asked the tower if he could make a right hand turn when leaving the traffic pattern instead of the usual left hand turn. The said yes, but that was a bad decision. He hit an incoming C-47 with 21 nurses aboard and that plane and him crashed into the St. Johns River, killing all of them. I can remember that like it was yesterday. Joe’s roommate was also my friend.

There were many Maydays and lost flyers but you never heard what happened after the crashes, just like nothing happened.

A little more on the corsair, When you were doing the gunnery hops and before you started shooting, you would charge your guns, like putting a shell in the chamber of a rifle. When you were through on the gunnery flight and coming back to the base, you uncharged your guns. You would not want to land with bullets in the chambers of the guns. One day a flyer forgot to uncharged his guns and when one of the mechanics got into the plane he grabbed the stick where the button was to fire the guns and fired a number of shots which went up into the air. When this happened, everybody started ducking. This type of accident happened more than you think.

The corsair had a beautiful gun sight. It was illuminating and when you were firing, the image of the ring sight would project and be on the target. It was a beautiful sight. You did not have to line up two individual sights. The main thing is you had to keep the ball in the ball and bank indicator centered like in a level for construction. The angle of the plane must be in the direction of your firing. You could not be in a slip or skid.

At this base we did mostly gunnery practice. We did not fire rockets and very little dive bombing, but that would come later. Each gun carried 400 rounds of bullets. When we fired the guns, we only fired 2 guns at one time. If you couldn’t hit with 2 guns you were in trouble. We could fire the inboard guns in each wing, or the center, or the outboard guns, or all at once. The ordinance would bore sight the guns from time to time. One of the troubles in firing is when the guns would jam. This happened when some of the bullets were shorter or longer. When the guns were loaded, the ammunition had to be the same size. There were many times when my guns would jam. You would charge and recharge them, but to no avail. You couldn’t go back so you went through your runs with out firing.

One day while standing around the field, we were told that a flyer was trying to land, but could not slow the engine down. He would pull the throttle back and nothing would happen. He made a number of passes at the field but could not make it work. Finally they told to him to fly low over the run way and a short distance from the end of the run way and shut the engine off. This gave him only one chance to get down safe. That’s what he did and it worked out good.

One thing you should do in every plane is to go to a high altitude, pull the throttle back and see what attitude you need to glide safely. No one did this. You did not have time, but in civilian flying you should do that. If the engine cut out in this high wing loading plane, you were not able to make turns as the plane would stall out. They told us if the engine cut out on take off, you should fly straight ahead and take what ever comes. It would be impossible to turn back to the field, and as you could in smaller planes like the piper cub or the Stearman.
