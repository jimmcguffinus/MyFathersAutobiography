# Chapter Eleven: Joining the Squadron

## Arrival at NAS Oceana
After our leave, we reported to Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia. This would be our home base as we prepared for deployment to the Pacific. The base was bustling with activity as squadrons formed and trained for combat operations.

## Air Group 95
I was assigned to Air Group 95, flying the F4U Corsair. The squadron was a mix of experienced pilots who had seen combat and new pilots fresh from training. We learned quickly from the veterans' experiences and stories from the Pacific theater.

## Advanced Combat Training
Our training intensified with a focus on actual combat scenarios. We practiced coordinated attacks, fighter sweeps, and escort missions. The emphasis was on teamwork and mutual support - skills that would keep us alive in combat.

## The F4U-1D Corsair
We flew the F4U-1D model, an improved version of the Corsair with modifications based on combat experience. The plane I flew most often, Bureau Number 50375, would later be preserved at the National Air and Space Museum, a testament to this historic period in Naval Aviation.

## Preparing for Deployment
As our training progressed, we began preparing for carrier deployment. The war in the Pacific was reaching its climax, and we knew we would soon be joining the fleet. The anticipation of actual combat weighed heavily on all of us.
