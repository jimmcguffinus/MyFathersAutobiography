# Chapter Fifteen: Life Aboard USS Hornet

## Daily Routines
Life aboard the carrier followed a strict routine. From pre-dawn briefings to night operations, every hour was carefully scheduled. Between missions, we studied intelligence reports, maintained our equipment, and tried to rest when possible.

## The Ready Room
The squadron ready room was our second home. Here we planned missions, received briefings, and waited for our turn to launch. The room had its own personality - a mix of tension and camaraderie that defined carrier aviation.

## Living Quarters
Space was at a premium on the carrier. Our quarters were cramped but functional. We learned to live with the constant noise, vibration, and motion of the ship. Sleep was precious when we could get it.

## Recreation and Downtime
During quiet periods, we found ways to pass the time. Card games were popular, and we shared books and magazines. Sometimes we'd gather to listen to radio broadcasts or share stories from home.

## The Ship's Community
The carrier was like a floating city, with thousands of men working together. From the mess crews to the flight deck handlers, everyone played a vital role. The mutual dependence created strong bonds among all aboard.
