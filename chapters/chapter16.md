# Chapter Sixteen: The Final Months

## Intensifying Operations
As 1945 progressed, our operations intensified. The enemy was becoming more desperate, and we saw an increase in kamikaze attacks. Every launch could bring us face to face with pilots determined to die taking us with them.

## News from Home
News of the European victory reached us in May 1945. While we celebrated for our comrades, we knew our war was far from over. Letters from home kept us connected to the world we'd left behind.

## Changing Tactics
The nature of our missions evolved as the war progressed. We spent more time supporting amphibious operations and striking mainland targets. The enemy's air presence was diminishing, but the anti-aircraft fire remained deadly.

## The Atomic Bombs
The news of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached us at sea. The implications were staggering, and we wondered what this new weapon meant for the future of warfare.

## Anticipating Peace
As rumors of surrender circulated, we maintained our combat readiness. The possibility of peace seemed both wonderful and strange after so many months of war. Yet we remained vigilant, knowing the war wasn't over until it was officially over.
