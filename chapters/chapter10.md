# Chapter Ten: Receiving Our Wings

## The Final Tests
The culmination of our training approached with a series of final check rides and examinations. Everything we had learned over the past months would be tested - our flying skills, navigation abilities, combat tactics, and carrier operations.

## Designation Ceremony
The day we received our wings was one of the proudest moments of our lives. Standing in formation, each of us was called forward to receive the gold wings that designated us as Naval Aviators. At age 20, I was among the youngest in Naval Aviation history.

## Assignment Orders
After receiving our wings, we anxiously awaited our squadron assignments. Some would go to fighter squadrons, others to dive bomber or torpedo units. The war in the Pacific was intensifying, and we knew we would soon be joining the fleet.

## Preparing for Combat
With our assignments in hand, we began preparing for the realities of combat operations. Veterans who had returned from the Pacific shared their experiences and advice. The gravity of what lay ahead began to sink in.

## A Brief Leave
Before reporting to our assigned squadrons, we were granted a short leave to visit home. For many of us, it would be our last time home before heading to the Pacific theater. The contrast between civilian life and what awaited us was stark.
