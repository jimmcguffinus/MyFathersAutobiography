# Chapter Ten: Designation Day

They send me to the main air station for graduation. It took 9 days to finally get to the day of graduation, and in the mean time, me and some of my friends would play golf and other things. They gave me 150.00 dollars to buy my uniforms. I went into downtown Pensacola to one of the tailors to get fitted. I canâ€™t remember which one. When they measured me for the green uniform, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I also bought 3 pairs of wings. In the years of 1939 and before, the Navy presented the wings to you on designation day.

On the day of designation our group of about 300 lined up in front of a brick platform and the Captain and commandant of the base, Rear Admiral H. F. MacComsey gave us our graduation certificate. This was called being designated a naval aviator. I have a postcard that shows the exact spot that we graduated. This platform is right across form what they called Admirals row, where there were about 6 of the most beautiful houses you ever saw. These buildings date to the Civil War.

We had a silver dollar that we would give to the first person to salute us. This was tradition and I believe the custom is still in use. The graduation date was July 28th 1944. The next day we went to administration building to get our orders. I was standing in from of the counter and a wave asked me my name so she could get my orders. While I was in Iowa preflight and resting on the grass, a Corsair came over us about 100 feet high and I said to myself, that is what I want. I never asked anyone for something, but I said to the wave, I sure would like Corsairs at Jacksonville. She left and came back and handed me my orders. I could see a smile on her face and sure enough that I what I got. This is the first time I asked for any thing.

After graduation, everything changed. I was allowed to go to the officers club, and many other things. My salary increase was from 75.00 per month to 300.00 dollars per month and subsistence and a housing allowance. This was a lot of money for that time. What really changed was we stayed in better quarters and no more making beds or taking care of your room. We had mostly black maids, some change.

There is a lot more I could say about the training at Pensacola, like what you did other than flying, but the memory is not so good. The size of the Air Station was really large and today there is another field big enough for flying jets. There is a beautiful museum there and the best in the United States.
