# Chapter One: Early Days and a Dream of Flight

The first time I thought of becoming a Navy pilot was in 1939, when I was in the 9th grade at Zimmerman Junior High School. The junior high was four short blocks away, along streets lined with old trees, mostly maples. The houses were small bungalows, usually with no more than four rooms, typically one bath and possibly two bedrooms. For families of five or more, it must have been a struggle.

My friends Gerald Nichols and Bob Thompson were always talking about becoming Navy pilots. During those years, interest in aviation, especially WWI aviation, was on the minds of most kids. My brother and I were always building model airplanes and reading the pulp paperbacks about WWI aviation.

I lived on the corner of Becker Street and Pershing Street. All the kids who lived in the neighborhood were called the Becker Street gang. Some of us were: Richard Asp, Skip Mills, Gerald Nichols, Robert Thompson, Raymond Yelland, Woody, Don, and Jack Skaff (from the family that sold carpets to just about everyone we knew). Other names include Bill Hart, Lowell Beach, Campbell Spence, and Fred Sovey.

Every night, you could find us underneath the streetlights playing all sorts of games, mostly getting into trouble. The Skaff’s lived on Ida Street, about two blocks from where I lived. That's where we played basketball in his garage. We nailed a 5-gallon can to a post and used a rubber ball for a basketball. When I would see one of the Skaff’s in later years, they would always bring up the basketball games we had there.

Woody was a senior at Central High School when most of us were in the ninth grade, and he was a star in both basketball and football. My brother and I chummed around with Skip Mills, who lived on Ida Street, almost across from the Skaff’s. He was one of the first ones to get a car—a big touring car. My brother and I helped him deliver papers in the car. Later on, he got a '37 Ford, and we traveled all over the city.

One night we were driving in the fog, and Skip went through a red light and hit a new Buick broadside. It was a miracle that we weren't all killed.

After school in the evening, everyone would go to the school, which was open. We played softball and baseball. The basketball courts had a pole with a basket on top of it, with no backboard, so you could shoot at the basket from any direction. Also, we played paddle tennis, which was like a small tennis court, and I got pretty good at that.

Gerald Nichols was one of the guys I hung around with. He and Bob Thompson lived on Brown Street, about a block from Zimmerman Junior High School. Bill Hart was a senior at that time and played football for Flint Central. He and the rest of us would play touch football in the streets between two telephone poles for end zones. Bill Hart could throw the football harder than anyone we knew. We thought he was one of the best in the state, but I guess fooling around was more important than school.

Old women, who lived near where our football game was being played in the street, would call the police every day trying to get us to stop playing in the street. The police car would pull up and give us the business while we were hanging on the car, asking us to stop. We did, until they disappeared around the corner, and then we started all over again.

My brother and I used to borrow tennis rackets from a friend and go to Hall Flats by the bridge on Court Street, where there were two tennis courts. That was the first time I played tennis. Hall Flats was about seven or eight blocks from where I lived, and if you look closely, you can still see where the tennis court used to be. That same area used to flood when there was a good rain.

We liked to play basketball at the YMCA, but you had to be a member to get in. We would find one guy who belonged and get him to go to the desk so the manager could ring the bell and unlock the door leading into the locker room and gym. We would line up by the door that was out of sight of the manager. As soon as the door was unlocked, five or six of us would sneak into the locker room and then spend a few hours playing basketball. I think the manager knew we were doing this but wouldn't do anything about it.

We used to go to Skip's house most of the time. He would play his record machine for hours, usually playing one record over and over. He was in good physical shape. Besides playing basketball, he would work out on the parallel bars in the backyard. A lot of our friends used to hang out at the YMCA. One guy would show us how strong he was by doing a handstand on just one finger. We seemed to spend more time at the "Y" than anywhere.

Another place we played basketball was in the north end of Flint at the Berston Field House. That is where the blacks lived, and if you wanted to smell a foul gym, that was the place to go.

High school started in the fall of 1939 at Flint Central High School, located about seven blocks from downtown Flint, and from where I lived, downtown was about the same distance. Every morning we would start out walking, and other kids would join us, and soon the line would stretch from Corunna Road, where I lived, all the way to Flint Central High School. It would take about 45 minutes. We did this every day, as the cost of the bus fare was too much for most of us, and besides, it was a lot of fun fooling around along the way.

Most of us did not know what course to take, as going to college was out of the question, so my friends and I decided Industrial Arts would be a good course to take. Shop math and woodworking were two of the courses. If I had known better, I would have taken the college course. I think that course was just as easy as Industrial Arts.

Whittier Junior High was right next to Central High School, and I had one class there, Shop Math. The school also had a gym there, and my brother and I would get a basketball and do some shooting. One day we were fooling around, and Lynn Chadnois was also practicing basketball, and Don and he got into some kind of argument. Don was quick with his temper and threw a basketball that hit Lynn in his face. Lynn was much bigger than Don and could have kicked his butt. As time went on, Lynn became a superstar in football and basketball and in college at Michigan State. He also became an All-American in football and played for the Pittsburgh Steelers for about six years. He was my friend then and for many years after that.

Don and I went out for the basketball team and made the reserve. Jerry Udell coached the reserve and was a wonderful person. We had more fun on the reserve than being on the varsity. In my second year, Don and I were both called up to the varsity. We lasted for a few weeks. Don was sent back to the reserve first, and I followed some time later.

Most of the guys in my senior year who played on the reserve decided to play intramural basketball, which we did for the rest of the time in high school, and I believe we had a better team than the varsity. We didn't like the way Dick Evans, the basketball coach, chose his players. In those years, the basketballs were all leather with stitching and lace where the tube was for filling the basketball with air. Also, Dick would not let any of us shoot the basketball one-handed. If he would see us shooting that way, he would kick us off the team. All shots from outside were to be shot two-handed. All of us shot the free throws underhanded, and most of us could make 80 out of 100 shots.

Years later, my son Bob and I would go to Freeman school for men’s night, and we would compete in the free throw contest. We would have 25 shots, and Bob would make at least 22, and I would make about 20, and no one could beat us.

Most of our offense on the basketball team was geared for lay-up shots, and that is the reason the scores were so low. We didn't take that many shots.

One day, Don and I were in the gym, and the tennis team was practicing. They had a net stretched across the gym making about a half court. Don says to me, "Why don't you go out for the team?" I thought that was a good idea, and it turned out to be the best thing I could have done. By the second year, I improved a lot and was playing on the varsity. Clem Rowe was the coach and was about 30 years old at the time. We went to the matches in cars from the players' families. We played six singles and three doubles. Usually, the single players also played in the doubles. On the varsity, we wore tennis jackets that had an Indian on the front. I thought that was pretty hot stuff wearing those jackets.

In the three years of tennis, our team won 36 straight matches, which is a record today, and you can find it recorded on the computer. In the second year, 1941, Bob Carr and I won the regional doubles tennis tournament at the Saginaw Tennis Club, and because of this, we went to the state tournament at the University of Michigan, and they called the Ferry Field. There were 50 clay courts at Ferry Field. Bob and I were seeded number 1, and I believe there were 16 teams. We won our first match but lost in the second round to a team from Kalamazoo named Stack and Stowe. Stack was the son of the head of the Kalamazoo tennis complex where the boy’s national tournament was held for years and is yet today. We won one set from them.

Bob Carr was valedictorian of our class in 1942 and won a four-year scholarship to Yale University. He spent the rest of his years in politics in Cleveland, Ohio, and played tennis until his death in 1993. His dad was the minister at the Court Street Church in Flint. His dad was at all of the home games, and when Bob got older, he looked just like I remember his dad looked.

If I had it to do over, I would have gone out for football, but only weighting 140 pounds. I thought I was too light.

In my senior year, I got a job at McDonald Dairy as a soda jerk. Gerald Nichols had moved from the Zimmerman school area to Kearsley Street near Flint Central High School, and very close to McDonald Dairy. Needless to say, Gerald would come over to McDonald Dairy for free malteds and hamburgers. I worked there for about three or four weeks before they fired all of us. The reason was someone was taking money out of the till, and they did not know who it was, so we all got booted.

My proudest moment was when Mr. and Mrs. McDonald came to the store, and I made chocolate sodas for them, and Mrs. McDonald said they were the worst sodas they had ever had. My salary was about 12 dollars a week, and I had more than enough money to spend for everything. Movies cost 5 or 10 cents.

We graduated in 1942, and our commencement was held at the IMA Auditorium downtown Flint, Michigan. I rented a beautiful white linen suit for the occasion, and after the commencement, me and three of my friends, one who had a car, went touring around the city after we bought a few bottles of wine. Gerald Nichols was one of them.

On Sunday, December 7th, I was walking to Gerald Nichols' house, quite a ways from my area. As I was walking down Kearsley Street near Malcom’s record shop, I heard a radio playing in front of the store. The announcer was saying the Japanese were bombing Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor didn’t mean anything to me. When I got to Gerald’s house, I told Mr. Nichols that I heard the Japanese were bombing Pearl Harbor, and you should have seen what he did, for he knew where that was.

Gerald Nichols and I used to go to the roller skating rinks, and one of the ways we got there was to borrow Gerald’s uncle’s '41 Chevrolet coupe. We use to stand around in his uncle’s house until his Uncle got tired of us and would throw the car keys at us and told us to get the hell out of there, which we did. One night Gerald made a turn too tight and went off the road and hit a culvert. That ended the night for us and future nights also.

It was time for me to find a job, and that was easy as all the young guys were enlisting in the service. My brother Jack, who was laid off from Fisher Body, had a job with Thorgeson and Ericson Steel Co. He got me a job there as a timekeeper at 1.00 an hour. I worked there for eight weeks and saved 800.00, and it was a good thing, as I would need some money when it came time to enlist in the Navy. I never did find out what I was supposed to do, as the Government was paying the wages. I was supposed to go around and check on the employees of all the contractors.
