# Chapter One: Early Days and a Dream of Flight

## Growing Up on Becker Street
The first time I thought of becoming a Navy pilot was in 1939, when I was in the 9th grade at Zimmerman Junior High School. The junior high was four short blocks away, along streets lined with old trees, mostly maples. The houses were small bungalows, usually with no more than four rooms, typically one bath and possibly two bedrooms. For families of five or more, it must have been a struggle.

My friends Gerald Nichols and Bob Thompson were always talking about becoming Navy pilots. During those years, interest in aviation, especially WWI aviation, was on the minds of most kids. My brother and I were always building model airplanes and reading the pulp paperbacks about WWI aviation.

## The Becker Street Gang
I lived on the corner of Becker Street and Pershing Street. All the kids who lived in the neighborhood were called the Becker Street gang. Some of us were: Richard Asp, Skip Mills, Gerald Nichols, Robert Thompson, Raymond Yelland, Woody, Don, and Jack Skaff (from the family that sold carpets to just about everyone we knew). Other names include Bill Hart, Lowell Beach, Campbell Spence, and Fred Sovey.
