# Chapter Two: Preparatory School at Wooster College, Wooster, Ohio

The train ride to Wooster College was short. A fellow by the name of John McDonald was riding beside me during the trip. I would be a friend of his until we were in primary flying Stearman bi-planes. He was at the top of the age bracket, I believe about 27 years old.

When we got to Wooster College, they divided us into sections and appointed someone to be a leader. That did not work out very well, as some of the leaders tried to be too aggressive, and they didn't last very long. I was assigned to Douglas Hall, and all of the Mc’s were put in the same rooms or close by. My roommates were McNulty, McFadden, and McGowon. All of them were college graduates or had two or more years of college. I know McNulty was a college graduate as he was smarter than most of the instructors. Two other friends were McSherry and McDonald. Not many were only 18 years old like me.

They issued us clothing, such as white underwear, black ties, brown leather high top shoes like in the army, and khaki pants and shirts. It seemed nice to have some pretty good clothes to wear for a change. We were the first group to arrive at Wooster College for pre-preflight. I believe they added this program to extend the length of the course because of the numbers that were enlisting in the aviation cadet program, so this made it much longer to get through the program. This course was strictly academics.

Some of the courses were English, Math, Engines, Navigation, Meteorology, and Recognition of airplanes. Most of the cadets, because they already had an education, didn’t have any trouble at all, and most of them knew all about cars and engines, which I did not. Also, I had only 9th-grade algebra.

The scoring system was the standard 4.0 grading. You must have a 2.5 average in order to pass. Everyday I would rush to the bulletin board to check my score and was sure happy to see my score above the 2.5 average. I had a difficult time with engines, but with help of my roommates, I passed o.k.

What was really strange was my instructor for that class was a woman. My instructor for navigation was a full Lt. naval aviator. The reason he was teaching a class was he got caught flat-hatting too close to the ground and was grounded forever. He was not a very happy guy and did not have his mind on his work. I used to look at him with his navy blue uniform and gold wings and wonder would I ever get there.

We had classes in most of the buildings and would march to them with the sound of music. They had speakers mounted to poles all over the campus. I wonder if any of this is recorded in the Wooster files. I don’t think so.

Wooster College is located about one hour and a half south of Cleveland and a bit east. Every week one of us would be room captain. We had to make sure the room was perfectly clean, such as the ashtrays cleaned, etc. Most of the guys were smokers, and I got quite a few demerits because of that. If you got 15 demerits, you were restricted to the college for the weekend, and you had to work off each demerit by cleaning and polishing woodwork.

They found out that some of the cadets had lice, so every once in a while they would come into your room, mostly at 2 or 3 in the morning, and flash a light on your crotch. If you had them, they would put some purple ointment on that area. Some fun.

One Saturday I went into town to look around, and on the way back, as I was passing the theater, a good-looking girl came out and started to walk with me. Before long, she had me by the arm, so I walked her home. When we got there, she wanted me to come into her house, and as the time was close to 9 o’clock and bed check, I politely told her I had to go and ran all the way to the College. When I got there, there was a full Lt. standing in the doorway checking the late ones. There were cadets coming out of everywhere. Before long, there were at least 20 cadets standing in front of the building.

There was a ¼ mile track in front of Douglas Hall. The Lt. said, “Get out on the track and start running,” which we did. We had been issued the tall army shoes, so you can imagine how difficult it was to run. This happened often, sometimes early in the morning, when some of the guys were having a party or for other reasons. It was common to wake up at 3 in the morning and hear running on the track.

There were quite a few musicians in our group, and you could hear music almost anytime. One of them was a famous accordion player from Detroit, Michigan. There was always a crowd around him.

My roommates, who were older than me and more experienced, were always trying to find out how my love life was. One weekend, four of us went to Toledo for the weekend fooling around. We took the train, as that was the only way to travel. When we got back, my roommates tried to find out what trouble we got into. If we did, we told them, and if we didn’t, we lied a lot.

In the classroom, we had to follow the rules: no putting your feet on the chair in front of you, and if you got caught cheating, you were all through. One of the guys was a star baseball player from Detroit, Mich., named Barney McCaskey. He played for Detroit for a number of years and was one of their best. Anyway, he was caught cheating, and he was sent to Great Lakes to become seamen 2nd class, as that was one of our orders. No excuses, you were just gone. Later on in primary, I was involved in some cheating, along with our full class. Very dumb thing to do, more about that later on.

The Navy would put on dances once in a while and invite all the College girls and other girls from all over. There was enough to go around. The classes were very difficult for me, but with the help of my friends, I passed everything. There were 200 in our class, and I found out only 160 passed. I guess the rest went to Great Lakes. I could not believe there were that many dumber then me as most of them were college students.

Not much to say about Wooster, except it was a beautiful college and has many memories for me.
