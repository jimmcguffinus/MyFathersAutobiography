# Chapter Two: Preparatory School at Wooster College

## First Days at Wooster
The train ride to Wooster College was short. A fellow by the name of John McDonald was riding beside me during the trip. I would be a friend of his until we were in primary flying Stearman bi-planes. He was at the top of the age bracket, I believe about 27 years old.

When we got to Wooster College, they divided us into sections and appointed someone to be a leader. That did not work out very well, as some of the leaders tried to be too aggressive, and they didn't last very long. I was assigned to Douglas Hall, and all of the Mc's were put in the same rooms or close by. My roommates were McNulty, McFadden, and McGowon. All of them were college graduates or had two or more years of college.

## Academic Challenges
Some of the courses were English, Math, Engines, Navigation, Meteorology, and Recognition of airplanes. Most of the cadets, because they already had an education, didn't have any trouble at all, and most of them knew all about cars and engines, which I did not. Also, I had only 9th-grade algebra.

The scoring system was the standard 4.0 grading. You must have a 2.5 average in order to pass. Everyday I would rush to the bulletin board to check my score and was sure happy to see my score above the 2.5 average. I had a difficult time with engines, but with help of my roommates, I passed o.k.

## Military Life and Discipline
Every week one of us would be room captain. We had to make sure the room was perfectly clean, such as the ashtrays cleaned, etc. Most of the guys were smokers, and I got quite a few demerits because of that. If you got 15 demerits, you were restricted to the college for the weekend, and you had to work off each demerit by cleaning and polishing woodwork.
