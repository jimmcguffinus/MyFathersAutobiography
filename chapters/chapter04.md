# Chapter Four: The University of Iowa Preflight School

## Life in the Quadrangle
When we arrived at the University of Iowa, they put us in a squad of about 50 cadets, and we stayed in the Quadrangle, which was a four-sided building with a courtyard in the center and exits on four sides. It was quite unique. The courses were athletics and academic, but mostly athletics.

## Physical Training and Athletics
Besides our academics, we had to go through all of the sports for at least 2 weeks each. These were football, boxing, swimming, and we played pushball, which was with a 6-foot rubber ball. For pushball there were 6 cadets on each team and 6 cadets on the sideline ready to go in when their team got too tired which was about 5 minutes and was as strenuous as soccer.

## Swimming and Survival Training
We had to pass a swimming test that consisted of jumping off a platform 40 feet high into the pool with our cloths on. Then we had to take our shirt off, tie knots in the sleeve, and show you could use your shirt as a floating device. Next, we had to take our pants off, tie knots in each leg, and also show you could float with the pants. As soon as we put our cloths on the side of the pool, we then had to swim for one hour using each one of the strokes, Side, Brest, back, and the Australian crawl.

## Military Discipline and Parades
Every Sunday would be parade day. Parents and relatives would come from all over the United States for our march to the parade ground which was every Sunday. We would muster in our dress uniforms and march to the parade ground in order of our length of stay at the school. On the parade ground, we would line up with the group that was about to leave being first in line and the newest would be in the back.

## The Seahawks Football Team
The preflight school at Iowa had one of the best football teams in the nation. Most of the cadets were college graduates, and the school had a number of all-Americans. They also had the best college coaches in the nation. The football team was called the Seahawks and played all of the major colleges, Ohio State, Michigan, Alabama.
