# Chapter Eight: Carrier Qualification Training

## Introduction to Carrier Operations
The most challenging phase of our training was preparing for carrier operations. Everything we had learned so far would be tested in the demanding environment of landing on a moving deck at sea. The margin for error was zero.

## Field Carrier Landing Practice
Before attempting actual carrier landings, we spent countless hours practicing at auxiliary fields. Landing Signal Officers (LSOs) would guide us through simulated carrier approaches, teaching us the precise glide slope and timing needed for carrier landings.

## First Carrier Approaches
The first time seeing an actual carrier from the air was intimidating. The deck looked impossibly small from our approach altitude. We had to trust our training and the LSO's signals, fighting our natural instinct to flare on landing.

## Qualifying in the SNJ
Our first actual carrier landings were made in the SNJ trainer. Each of us had to complete a series of successful landings and takeoffs to qualify. The tension in the ready room before our qualification flights was palpable.

## Moving to Combat Aircraft
After qualifying in the SNJ, we began transitioning to actual combat aircraft. The procedures were the same, but everything happened faster in the more powerful fighters and dive bombers. Each type of aircraft presented its own challenges for carrier operations.
