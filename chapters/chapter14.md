# Chapter Fourteen: Combat Missions

## First Combat
The transition from training to actual combat was jarring. Everything we had learned was put to the test, but nothing could fully prepare us for the reality of engaging enemy aircraft and facing anti-aircraft fire.

## Fighter Sweeps
Our fighter sweeps took us deep into enemy territory. The Corsair's long range made these missions possible, but they were still dangerous. We had to maintain constant vigilance for enemy aircraft while managing our fuel consumption.

## Escort Duty
Protecting our bombers and torpedo planes was a crucial mission. The enemy fighters would try to get to our bombers, and it was our job to keep them away. The responsibility of protecting our fellow aviators weighed heavily on us.

## Ground Attack
The Corsair proved to be an excellent ground attack aircraft. Armed with rockets and bombs, we could provide devastating support to our ground forces. But these missions brought us into the teeth of enemy anti-aircraft fire.

## Night Operations
Night operations were particularly challenging. Taking off and landing on a carrier at night required absolute concentration. The phosphorescent wake of the carrier was often our only visual reference in the darkness of the Pacific night.
