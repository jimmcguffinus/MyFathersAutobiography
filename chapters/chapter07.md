# Chapter Seven: Advanced Training at Pensacola

## The SNJ Advanced Trainer
After completing the initial phases at Pensacola, we moved on to the SNJ advanced trainer. This was a more powerful aircraft than the Stearman, with a closed cockpit and retractable landing gear. The SNJ would prepare us for the transition to actual combat aircraft.

## Instrument Training
One of the most challenging aspects was learning to fly solely by instruments. We had to master the radio range navigation system, using the A-N signals to stay on course. The training was intense, with many hours spent under the hood, trusting only our instruments.

## Formation Flying
Formation flying became more complex in the SNJ. We learned combat formations, section tactics, and how to maintain position in various weather conditions. The discipline required for close formation flying would be essential for our future combat operations.

## Night Operations
Night flying at Pensacola was different from our earlier experiences. We had to master night navigation, formation flying in darkness, and carrier approach patterns. The lights of Pensacola Bay could be disorienting, but they helped prepare us for future night carrier operations.

## Gunnery Training
We began our first real gunnery training in the SNJ. This involved both air-to-ground and air-to-air target practice. Learning to hit a target while managing all aspects of flying the aircraft was a new challenge that would prove crucial in combat.
