# Chapter Twenty: After the War

## The Becker Street Gang After the War
Gerald Nichols was killed shooting a Jap down while flying off the USS Yorktown. He was awarded the Air Medal and I think for what he did he should have gotten the Navy Cross. January 1945. 

Ray Yelland flew B-24s and was shot down in the Kurial Islands and managed to survive after spending a week trapped in snow 5 or 6 feet high. He was sent home through the underground and through Russia and was discharged because, if he were taken as a captive, he would be tried as a spy. He was awarded the DFC and the Air Medal. 

Bill Hart flew C 46s over the hump in China and he survived o.k. Dick Asp was in the navy and got home safe. Robert Taylor did not go into the service. Campbell Spence was in the navy and shortly after he got home, he died of cancer. Skip Mills was a navigator and I don't think he saw combat. Bob Thompson was sent to San Diego to join an Air Group, but before he had a chance to go into combat, he was killed night flying. He crashed into a mountain, south of San Diego. None of the Skaffs went into the service.

## A Footnote
The United States navy donated an F4U-1D to the National Air and Space Museum in September 1960. Vought delivered this Corsair, Bureau of Aeronautics serial number 50375, to the Navy on April 26, 1944. By October, pilots of VF-10 were flying it but in November, the airplane was transferred to VF-89 at Naval Air Station Atlantic City. It remained there as the squadron moved to Naval Air Station Oceana and NAS Norfolk. During February 1945, the Navy withdrew the airplane from active service and transferred it to a pool of surplus aircraft stored at Quantico, Virginia. 

In 1980, NASM craftsmen restored the F4U-1D in the colors and markings of a Corsair named "Sun Setter," a fighter assigned to Marine Fighter Squadron VMF-114 when that unit served aboard the USS Essex in July 1944. The plane is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum at Dulles Air Field, Washington. This plane was flown by all the pilots in my Air Group 95 while we were stationed at NAS Oceana, Virginia in June of 1944. The number 50375 is listed in my log book. The pictures of this plane called the sun setter shows the plane with number 56 on the fuselage.
