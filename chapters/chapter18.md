# Chapter Eighteen: The Journey Home

## Orders to Return
When our orders to return home finally came, it felt unreal. After so many months at sea, focusing on survival and victory, the concept of going home seemed almost foreign. Yet here we were, preparing for our final voyage.

## The Long Voyage
The journey home was different from our combat voyages. The tension was gone, replaced by anticipation and reflection. We spent hours talking about our plans for civilian life, though many of us could hardly imagine it.

## Saying Goodbye
Leaving the squadron was harder than expected. These men had become more than comrades - they were brothers. We had shared experiences that civilians could never fully understand. The bonds formed in combat would last a lifetime.

## Arrival in San Francisco
Seeing the Golden Gate Bridge appear through the morning fog was unforgettable. The welcome home celebration was overwhelming - crowds cheering, bands playing. But part of us remained distant, still processing all we had experienced.

## Adjusting to Peace
The first days back were strange. The civilian world seemed to move at a different pace. Simple things like sleeping in a real bed or eating at a restaurant felt novel. We were changed men returning to an unchanged hometown.
