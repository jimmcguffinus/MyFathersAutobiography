# Chapter Nine: Combat Aircraft Training

## The F4U Corsair
Our introduction to the F4U Corsair was both exciting and intimidating. The bent-wing fighter was the most powerful aircraft any of us had flown. With its massive 2,000 horsepower engine and distinctive whistling sound, it was a far cry from our training aircraft.

## Learning New Systems
The combat aircraft brought new systems and procedures to master. We had to learn the intricacies of the complex hydraulic systems, combat radios, and weapons systems. The responsibility of handling such an advanced fighter weighed heavily on us.

## Advanced Combat Tactics
Our training now focused on actual combat maneuvers. We practiced dogfighting, dive bombing, and strafing runs. The instructors, many with combat experience, taught us tactics that had been learned the hard way in actual combat.

## Squadron Formation
We began operating as part of a squadron, learning the teamwork and coordination required for combat operations. The emphasis was on working together, protecting each other, and executing complex mission plans as a unit.

## Final Preparations
As our training neared completion, we focused on the specific mission types we would fly in combat. For some it was fighter escort, for others dive bombing or anti-shipping strikes. Each role required specialized skills and tactics.
