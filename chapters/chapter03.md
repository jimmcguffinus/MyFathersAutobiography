# Chapter Three: War Training Service - The Piper Cub

## Journey to Mt. Pleasant
We got our orders to Mt. Pleasant, Michigan, to learn how to fly, and that was what we were waiting for. There were about 20 of us going there, and all of us had names starting with M, so you know how they picked us. Where the rest went, who knows?

## First Flight Experiences
My first flight in the Piper Cub was not very good. The instructor showed me some of the basic things to do. Every time he would make a turn, I would try to keep my body straight up and down. The instructor said relax and go with the turn. He put a notation in my log book that said "FIRST TIME UP, SLIGHTLY TENSE." That was an understatement. I never had that instructor again.

## Learning to Solo
After coming in for a landing, my instructor got out of the plane and said, "Take the plane up by yourself." Soloing is one of the important flights as there is only one of those. I was shocked that he wanted me to go alone, but as soon as I got off the ground, I found out it was much easier, especially not having someone watching over you. When I landed, he marked me 2 for both landings and takeoffs. My hours at that time were 7 hours and 40 minutes, which was fairly fast.

## Adventures and Close Calls
One of my friends was doing some acrobatics, a slow roll. You had to pull back on the stick very fast, push to the right, or left, and then neutralize the controls. When you did one to the left, your arm would go across the lever to unhook your seat belt. My friend Ray Lynch did this and his seat belt came loose and he ended out of the plane lying on top of the fuselage. He dove back in head first into the cockpit and from then on he wired the belt so they wouldn't come loose.
