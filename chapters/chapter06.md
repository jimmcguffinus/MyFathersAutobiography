# Chapter Six: Training at N.A.S. Pensacola, Florida - The Annapolis of the Air

We left NAS Ottumwa, Iowa after a 3-day leave. I did not know where I would be going. They never told us ahead of time. Those cadets who were successful in completing all stages of primary flight training were ready to go on to intermediate training school at Corpus Christi or Pensacola. I was lucky to be picked to go to Pensacola, where the original Navy pilot trained.

A group of us boarded a train for the trip to Pensacola. Most of the cadets were aggressive and full of piss and vinegar, so on the way, they got some whiskey and bribed the conductor to leave the bunks down, so we could sleep any time we wanted to. A little money also helped. You can imagine that it was one party all the way.

After one stop in St. Louis, we arrived at the train station in Pensacola. We boarded the same old cattle cars to get to the air station. Walking through the gates at Pensacola was quite a feeling, just knowing of all the naval aviators who passed through those gates. I thought naval aviation had been around for ages while in 1944 it was only 30 years from the beginning. Now as I type this, 60 years have gone by and soon it will be 100 years, but I will be in the grave. The base dates before the Civil War and was called The Navy Yard. And later, it was called the N.A.S. Pensacola, Florida.

We spent one week for indoctrination at the main air station where before 1942, all the training was done there in 5 phases, the same as our training at different bases around the United States. The main air station is located just 15 minutes from downtown Pensacola and is called the “The Annapolis of the air”. The station dates to 1914 for the first Naval Aviators beginning with the naval aviator # 1 Theodore G. Ellyson who got his wings, March 4th, 1913.

While at the main station, they took pictures of us and assigned us to a group number or class number. After we were there about a week, we were transferred to the naval air station, Ellyson field, which was not that far from the main air station. They put us in the usual barracks, 2 to a room. I remember my roommates name was Navare who was from Lansing, Michigan. We were also put in a group of 3 cadets for our flying and I don’t remember the names of any of them. The plane we were to fly was the SNV-3 Vultee Vibrater. The plane had a 450HP engine and a non retractable landing gear. The Propeller was a 2 stage prop, which were either full pitch or low pitch and nothing in between.

The first part of the training at Pensacola was flying around, getting use to the new plane. I remember that when landing you had to be careful as the plane floated a long ways and one good thing was the landing gear was wide apart, which made it more difficult to ground loop. You took off in low pitch and after you got up to about a 1000 feet you put the prop in high pitch, which would be like rowing a boat with the oars straight up and down.

There was no such thing as soloing a plane, you just got in and took off, and that was the way from then on. When you were in your barracks and the planes were taking off, as they used low pitch, the noise was so laud you couldn’t hear anything. In the morning when you didn’t have anything to do, it was impossible to sleep. The windows would shake.

All through the training the system was the same. You went out to the flight line to look for your name on a large blackboard. Also to find out whom you were going to fly with. You got so you knew who the easy instructors were, and we called then Santa Claus. I remember my main instructors name was Collins and was a very nice guy. When you were coming back to the field, there was a certain place the instructors would turn off the gas. When your engine cut off in an emergency, there was a certain procedure or check off you went through. I knew the spot this would happen and would have my hand on the gas lever for the turn off and as the instructor turned it off, I would turn it on right away. Sometimes the instructor would get a laugh out of that.

After we had a few hours, we started flying in a 3 plane formation. We practiced cross over’s and switching around to different positions At this base is where you were to decide if you wanted to be a navy, marine corps, or coast guard pilot. I only wanted to be a navy pilot, but my room mate wanted to be a Marine Pilot. I told him the only reason was he wanted to be in the marines was to wear the Sam Brown Belt. He sold me his cadet uniforms as you could convert them to Navy officer’s uniforms when you graduated.

We were not going to be at Ellyson field very long and I finished with 20 hours flight time. Our next base would be Whiting Field, located near Milton, Florida, not very far away. This is where we would learn to fly on instruments in an SNJ which was a 650 H.P. engine with retractable landing gear and constant speed propeller. Constant speed meaning, when you set the R.P.M, such as at 2000 R.P.M it would stay at that speed.

Ted Williams was taking basic the same time as I was and every time he did something stupid, the news would put it in the paper. They dressed him up in a uniform for pictures, but put his shoulder boards on backwards. The cadets had a copy of that on all of the bulletin boards. He became a marine flyer and after graduating, he became an instructor for a couple of years at Pensacola. Later on when the war was coming to a close, the navy would start washing cadets out for no reason. Being an instructor is why he never saw combat in ww11, but did in Korea.

When it became time for our final check, our instructor Collins met us in the hanger and told us we had already passed and to go up and have a good time. He said I will be around watching. You would see him from time to time. That is the only time this happened to me, pretty good for a change. My log book shows I went up with an instructor only 6 times.

The city of Pensacola was located about 15 minutes from the main station and airfield. The downtown city was very beautiful with a center section of trees and grass going the length of the main street.
