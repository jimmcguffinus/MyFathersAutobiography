# Chapter Six: Training at NAS Pensacola - The Annapolis of the Air

## Journey to Pensacola
We left NAS Ottumwa, Iowa after a 3-day leave. I did not know where I would be going. They never told us ahead of time. Those cadets who were successful in completing all stages of primary flight training were ready to go on to intermediate training school at Corpus Christi or Pensacola. I was lucky to be picked to go to Pensacola, where the original Navy pilot trained.

## The Train Journey
A group of us boarded a train for the trip to Pensacola. Most of the cadets were aggressive and full of piss and vinegar, so on the way, they got some whiskey and bribed the conductor to leave the bunks down, so we could sleep any time we wanted to. A little money also helped. You can imagine that it was one party all the way.

## Arriving at the Historic Base
After one stop in St. Louis, we arrived at the train station in Pensacola. We boarded the same old cattle cars to get to the air station. Walking through the gates at Pensacola was quite a feeling, just knowing of all the naval aviators who passed through those gates. I thought naval aviation had been around for ages while in 1944 it was only 30 years from the beginning. The base dates before the Civil War and was called The Navy Yard. And later, it was called the N.A.S. Pensacola, Florida.

## Historical Context
Before 1942 all future pilots took their training at the N.A.S. Pensacola and stayed there until they were designated a naval aviator. The training took about 12 months and consisted of 5 stages, beginning with bi-planes. The next stage was flying on the water with float planes. Then the pilots went on to heavier planes and instrument training. After that, they flew heavy flying boats and finally on to airplanes they would fly in combat.

## The Changing Face of Naval Aviation
By the end of 1942 there were about 6000 designated naval aviators. From 1942 till the end of the war the system changed by sending the cadets to different fields located all over the United States for each stage and finally to Pensacola or Corpus Christi, Texas, and from there to fields located in Florida for advanced training in combat airplanes. When these cadets graduated, most of them were only 19 or 20 years of age and were the youngest in the history of Naval Aviation. I just turned 20 when I was designated a Naval Aviator.
