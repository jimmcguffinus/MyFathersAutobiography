# Naval Aviation of Robert Ewen McGaffin 1942 to 1945

## CHAPTER ONE: Early Days and a Dream of Flight

The first time I thought of becoming a Navy pilot was in 1939, when I was in the 9th grade at Zimmerman Junior High School. The junior high was four short blocks away, along streets lined with old trees, mostly maples. The houses were small bungalows, usually with no more than four rooms, typically one bath and possibly two bedrooms. For families of five or more, it must have been a struggle.

My friends Gerald Nichols and Bob Thompson were always talking about becoming Navy pilots. During those years, interest in aviation, especially WWI aviation, was on the minds of most kids. My brother and I were always building model airplanes and reading the pulp paperbacks about WWI aviation.

I lived on the corner of Becker Street and Pershing Street. All the kids who lived in the neighborhood were called the Becker Street gang. Some of us were: Richard Asp, Skip Mills, Gerald Nichols, Robert Thompson, Raymond Yelland, Woody, Don, and Jack Skaff (from the family that sold carpets to just about everyone we knew). Other names include Bill Hart, Lowell Beach, Campbell Spence, and Fred Sovey.

Every night, you could find us underneath the streetlights playing all sorts of games, mostly getting into trouble. The Skaff’s lived on Ida Street, about two blocks from where I lived. That's where we played basketball in his garage. We nailed a 5-gallon can to a post and used a rubber ball for a basketball. When I would see one of the Skaff’s in later years, they would always bring up the basketball games we had there.

Woody was a senior at Central High School when most of us were in the ninth grade, and he was a star in both basketball and football. My brother and I chummed around with Skip Mills, who lived on Ida Street, almost across from the Skaff’s. He was one of the first ones to get a car—a big touring car. My brother and I helped him deliver papers in the car. Later on, he got a '37 Ford, and we traveled all over the city.

One night we were driving in the fog, and Skip went through a red light and hit a new Buick broadside. It was a miracle that we weren't all killed.

After school in the evening, everyone would go to the school, which was open. We played softball and baseball. The basketball courts had a pole with a basket on top of it, with no backboard, so you could shoot at the basket from any direction. Also, we played paddle tennis, which was like a small tennis court, and I got pretty good at that.

Gerald Nichols was one of the guys I hung around with. He and Bob Thompson lived on Brown Street, about a block from Zimmerman Junior High School. Bill Hart was a senior at that time and played football for Flint Central. He and the rest of us would play touch football in the streets between two telephone poles for end zones. Bill Hart could throw the football harder than anyone we knew. We thought he was one of the best in the state, but I guess fooling around was more important than school.

Old women, who lived near where our football game was being played in the street, would call the police every day trying to get us to stop playing in the street. The police car would pull up and give us the business while we were hanging on the car, asking us to stop. We did, until they disappeared around the corner, and then we started all over again.

My brother and I used to borrow tennis rackets from a friend and go to Hall Flats by the bridge on Court Street, where there were two tennis courts. That was the first time I played tennis. Hall Flats was about seven or eight blocks from where I lived, and if you look closely, you can still see where the tennis court used to be. That same area used to flood when there was a good rain.

We liked to play basketball at the YMCA, but you had to be a member to get in. We would find one guy who belonged and get him to go to the desk so the manager could ring the bell and unlock the door leading into the locker room and gym. We would line up by the door that was out of sight of the manager. As soon as the door was unlocked, five or six of us would sneak into the locker room and then spend a few hours playing basketball. I think the manager knew we were doing this but wouldn't do anything about it.

We used to go to Skip's house most of the time. He would play his record machine for hours, usually playing one record over and over. He was in good physical shape. Besides playing basketball, he would work out on the parallel bars in the backyard. A lot of our friends used to hang out at the YMCA. One guy would show us how strong he was by doing a handstand on just one finger. We seemed to spend more time at the "Y" than anywhere.

Another place we played basketball was in the north end of Flint at the Berston Field House. That is where the blacks lived, and if you wanted to smell a foul gym, that was the place to go.

High school started in the fall of 1939 at Flint Central High School, located about seven blocks from downtown Flint, and from where I lived, downtown was about the same distance. Every morning we would start out walking, and other kids would join us, and soon the line would stretch from Corunna Road, where I lived, all the way to Flint Central High School. It would take about 45 minutes. We did this every day, as the cost of the bus fare was too much for most of us, and besides, it was a lot of fun fooling around along the way.

Most of us did not know what course to take, as going to college was out of the question, so my friends and I decided Industrial Arts would be a good course to take. Shop math and woodworking were two of the courses. If I had known better, I would have taken the college course. I think that course was just as easy as Industrial Arts.

Whittier Junior High was right next to Central High School, and I had one class there, Shop Math. The school also had a gym there, and my brother and I would get a basketball and do some shooting. One day we were fooling around, and Lynn Chadnois was also practicing basketball, and Don and he got into some kind of argument. Don was quick with his temper and threw a basketball that hit Lynn in his face. Lynn was much bigger than Don and could have kicked his butt. As time went on, Lynn became a superstar in football and basketball and in college at Michigan State. He also became an All-American in football and played for the Pittsburgh Steelers for about six years. He was my friend then and for many years after that.

Don and I went out for the basketball team and made the reserve. Jerry Udell coached the reserve and was a wonderful person. We had more fun on the reserve than being on the varsity. In my second year, Don and I were both called up to the varsity. We lasted for a few weeks. Don was sent back to the reserve first, and I followed some time later.

Most of the guys in my senior year who played on the reserve decided to play intramural basketball, which we did for the rest of the time in high school, and I believe we had a better team than the varsity. We didn't like the way Dick Evans, the basketball coach, chose his players. In those years, the basketballs were all leather with stitching and lace where the tube was for filling the basketball with air. Also, Dick would not let any of us shoot the basketball one-handed. If he would see us shooting that way, he would kick us off the team. All shots from outside were to be shot two-handed. All of us shot the free throws underhanded, and most of us could make 80 out of 100 shots.

Years later, my son Bob and I would go to Freeman school for men’s night, and we would compete in the free throw contest. We would have 25 shots, and Bob would make at least 22, and I would make about 20, and no one could beat us.

Most of our offense on the basketball team was geared for lay-up shots, and that is the reason the scores were so low. We didn't take that many shots.

One day, Don and I were in the gym, and the tennis team was practicing. They had a net stretched across the gym making about a half court. Don says to me, "Why don't you go out for the team?" I thought that was a good idea, and it turned out to be the best thing I could have done. By the second year, I improved a lot and was playing on the varsity. Clem Rowe was the coach and was about 30 years old at the time. We went to the matches in cars from the players' families. We played six singles and three doubles. Usually, the single players also played in the doubles. On the varsity, we wore tennis jackets that had an Indian on the front. I thought that was pretty hot stuff wearing those jackets.

In the three years of tennis, our team won 36 straight matches, which is a record today, and you can find it recorded on the computer. In the second year, 1941, Bob Carr and I won the regional doubles tennis tournament at the Saginaw Tennis Club, and because of this, we went to the state tournament at the University of Michigan, and they called the Ferry Field. There were 50 clay courts at Ferry Field. Bob and I were seeded number 1, and I believe there were 16 teams. We won our first match but lost in the second round to a team from Kalamazoo named Stack and Stowe. Stack was the son of the head of the Kalamazoo tennis complex where the boy’s national tournament was held for years and is yet today. We won one set from them.

Bob Carr was valedictorian of our class in 1942 and won a four-year scholarship to Yale University. He spent the rest of his years in politics in Cleveland, Ohio, and played tennis until his death in 1993. His dad was the minister at the Court Street Church in Flint. His dad was at all of the home games, and when Bob got older, he looked just like I remember his dad looked.

If I had it to do over, I would have gone out for football, but only weighting 140 pounds. I thought I was too light.

In my senior year, I got a job at McDonald Dairy as a soda jerk. Gerald Nichols had moved from the Zimmerman school area to Kearsley Street near Flint Central High School, and very close to McDonald Dairy. Needless to say, Gerald would come over to McDonald Dairy for free malteds and hamburgers. I worked there for about three or four weeks before they fired all of us. The reason was someone was taking money out of the till, and they did not know who it was, so we all got booted.

My proudest moment was when Mr. and Mrs. McDonald came to the store, and I made chocolate sodas for them, and Mrs. McDonald said they were the worst sodas they had ever had. My salary was about 12 dollars a week, and I had more than enough money to spend for everything. Movies cost 5 or 10 cents.

We graduated in 1942, and our commencement was held at the IMA Auditorium downtown Flint, Michigan. I rented a beautiful white linen suit for the occasion, and after the commencement, me and three of my friends, one who had a car, went touring around the city after we bought a few bottles of wine. Gerald Nichols was one of them.

On Sunday, December 7th, I was walking to Gerald Nichols' house, quite a ways from my area. As I was walking down Kearsley Street near Malcom’s record shop, I heard a radio playing in front of the store. The announcer was saying the Japanese were bombing Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor didn’t mean anything to me. When I got to Gerald’s house, I told Mr. Nichols that I heard the Japanese were bombing Pearl Harbor, and you should have seen what he did, for he knew where that was.

Gerald Nichols and I used to go to the roller skating rinks, and one of the ways we got there was to borrow Gerald’s uncle’s '41 Chevrolet coupe. We use to stand around in his uncle’s house until his Uncle got tired of us and would throw the car keys at us and told us to get the hell out of there, which we did. One night Gerald made a turn too tight and went off the road and hit a culvert. That ended the night for us and future nights also.

It was time for me to find a job, and that was easy as all the young guys were enlisting in the service. My brother Jack, who was laid off from Fisher Body, had a job with Thorgeson and Ericson Steel Co. He got me a job there as a timekeeper at 1.00 an hour. I worked there for eight weeks and saved 800.00, and it was a good thing, as I would need some money when it came time to enlist in the Navy. I never did find out what I was supposed to do, as the Government was paying the wages. I was supposed to go around and check on the employees of all the contractors.

Okay, here is Chapter 2 onwards, in Markdown format, with similar minor edits as the first chapter:

## CHAPTER TWO: Preparatory School at Wooster College, Wooster, Ohio

The train ride to Wooster College was short. A fellow by the name of John McDonald was riding beside me during the trip. I would be a friend of his until we were in primary flying Stearman bi-planes. He was at the top of the age bracket, I believe about 27 years old.

When we got to Wooster College, they divided us into sections and appointed someone to be a leader. That did not work out very well, as some of the leaders tried to be too aggressive, and they didn't last very long. I was assigned to Douglas Hall, and all of the Mc’s were put in the same rooms or close by. My roommates were McNulty, McFadden, and McGowon. All of them were college graduates or had two or more years of college. I know McNulty was a college graduate as he was smarter than most of the instructors. Two other friends were McSherry and McDonald. Not many were only 18 years old like me.

They issued us clothing, such as white underwear, black ties, brown leather high top shoes like in the army, and khaki pants and shirts. It seemed nice to have some pretty good clothes to wear for a change. We were the first group to arrive at Wooster College for pre-preflight. I believe they added this program to extend the length of the course because of the numbers that were enlisting in the aviation cadet program, so this made it much longer to get through the program. This course was strictly academics.

Some of the courses were English, Math, Engines, Navigation, Meteorology, and Recognition of airplanes. Most of the cadets, because they already had an education, didn’t have any trouble at all, and most of them knew all about cars and engines, which I did not. Also, I had only 9th-grade algebra.

The scoring system was the standard 4.0 grading. You must have a 2.5 average in order to pass. Everyday I would rush to the bulletin board to check my score and was sure happy to see my score above the 2.5 average. I had a difficult time with engines, but with help of my roommates, I passed o.k.

What was really strange was my instructor for that class was a woman. My instructor for navigation was a full Lt. naval aviator. The reason he was teaching a class was he got caught flat-hatting too close to the ground and was grounded forever. He was not a very happy guy and did not have his mind on his work. I used to look at him with his navy blue uniform and gold wings and wonder would I ever get there.

We had classes in most of the buildings and would march to them with the sound of music. They had speakers mounted to poles all over the campus. I wonder if any of this is recorded in the Wooster files. I don’t think so.

Wooster College is located about one hour and a half south of Cleveland and a bit east. Every week one of us would be room captain. We had to make sure the room was perfectly clean, such as the ashtrays cleaned, etc. Most of the guys were smokers, and I got quite a few demerits because of that. If you got 15 demerits, you were restricted to the college for the weekend, and you had to work off each demerit by cleaning and polishing woodwork.

They found out that some of the cadets had lice, so every once in a while they would come into your room, mostly at 2 or 3 in the morning, and flash a light on your crotch. If you had them, they would put some purple ointment on that area. Some fun.

One Saturday I went into town to look around, and on the way back, as I was passing the theater, a good-looking girl came out and started to walk with me. Before long, she had me by the arm, so I walked her home. When we got there, she wanted me to come into her house, and as the time was close to 9 o’clock and bed check, I politely told her I had to go and ran all the way to the College. When I got there, there was a full Lt. standing in the doorway checking the late ones. There were cadets coming out of everywhere. Before long, there were at least 20 cadets standing in front of the building.

There was a ¼ mile track in front of Douglas Hall. The Lt. said, “Get out on the track and start running,” which we did. We had been issued the tall army shoes, so you can imagine how difficult it was to run. This happened often, sometimes early in the morning, when some of the guys were having a party or for other reasons. It was common to wake up at 3 in the morning and hear running on the track.

There were quite a few musicians in our group, and you could hear music almost anytime. One of them was a famous accordion player from Detroit, Michigan. There was always a crowd around him.

My roommates, who were older than me and more experienced, were always trying to find out how my love life was. One weekend, four of us went to Toledo for the weekend fooling around. We took the train, as that was the only way to travel. When we got back, my roommates tried to find out what trouble we got into. If we did, we told them, and if we didn’t, we lied a lot.

In the classroom, we had to follow the rules: no putting your feet on the chair in front of you, and if you got caught cheating, you were all through. One of the guys was a star baseball player from Detroit, Mich., named Barney McCaskey. He played for Detroit for a number of years and was one of their best. Anyway, he was caught cheating, and he was sent to Great Lakes to become seamen 2nd class, as that was one of our orders. No excuses, you were just gone. Later on in primary, I was involved in some cheating, along with our full class. Very dumb thing to do, more about that later on.

The Navy would put on dances once in a while and invite all the College girls and other girls from all over. There was enough to go around. The classes were very difficult for me, but with the help of my friends, I passed everything. There were 200 in our class, and I found out only 160 passed. I guess the rest went to Great Lakes. I could not believe there were that many dumber then me as most of them were college students.

Not much to say about Wooster, except it was a beautiful college and has many memories for me.

## CHAPTER THREE: War Training Service Training for the Piper Cub Airplane

We got our orders to Mt. Pleasant, Michigan, to learn how to fly, and that was what we were waiting for. There were about 20 of us going there, and all of us had names starting with M, so you know how they picked us. Where the rest went, who knows?

My memory is short on some of this, but I do know we boarded a bus which had wicker seats. The ride to Mt. Pleasant was slow, as the roads were only two lanes, and not many of them. I tried to remember the route, and I think we traveled on highway 250, which went to Toledo, Ohio, and on up to Saginaw, Flint, and north on the old highway U.S. 23 to Mt. Pleasant, Michigan, and to Mt. Pleasant Teachers College to start our training to fly. The bus we traveled on was pretty old.

We stopped a number of times, and the stores at that time had one-armed bandits, which we played a lot. When we arrived at Mt. Pleasant, they assigned us rooms in the student union. It was a beautiful building with a large lounge of beautiful paneling. The wide stairway was in the middle of the lounge, at least 15 feet wide. Upstairs was a large room used for dancing and other events? Our rooms were on the first floor with tall windows, easy to get out of in case you wanted to go somewhere after bed check.

At Mt. Pleasant, we had both academics and flying. The airport was about three miles from the school along the old US 23 to highway 20. The way we got to the airport was by a big cattle car, large enough to carry at least 50 cadets with benches along the side. The academics consisted of Navigation, Meteorology, and other related courses. All of this was in the regular classrooms that the other college students used. As usual, we marched to class in a squad.

We were the first ones to start training at Mt. Pleasant for the Navy, and before we left, there were two other groups there. The Navy told the college to give us a tough course in physical training, and the head coach said yes sir, and what he put us through was really tough. We ran the mile or two-mile course for time and other things. All in my group would run at the same time, but there were only two of us who would really try, Bob Sloan and me. Bob was really a good athletic, especially in basketball and football. He was from Indiana, and I guess that’s why he was so good in Basketball. Whether we ran the mile or two-mile race, he always came in first. Just before every one-mile race, the coach would tell me to give it all I got, hoping I would beat Bob Sloan, but that never happened.

The campus was very small. It was a few buildings within a ½ mile square with some dorms on the outskirts. The swimming pool was very small, and when you dove off the diving board, you could touch the ceiling. As the years went by, the college grew to be much larger and was excellent in sports in division II.

My first flight in the Piper Cub was not very good. The instructor showed me some of the basic things to do. Every time he would make a turn, I would try to keep my body straight up and down. The instructor said relax and go with the turn. He put a notation in my log book that said “FIRST TIME UP, SLIGHTLY TENSE.” That was an understatement. I never had that instructor again.

My final instructor was named Michael Calley, who was about 20 years old and had 2000 hours flying time. The first time I went up with him, I found out he was a daredevil and a very good pilot. The second time we flew, I scared the hell out of him with my takeoff. In the log book, they marked you 1 to 5, 5 being the worst, for each item such as landings, takeoffs, gliding, holding your airspeed, and many others. He marked me a 5 for takeoffs and he said he might have to go back and change his shorts. After the 3rd or 4th flight, I got the hang of it, and my marks started to get better.

After coming in for a landing, my instructor got out of the plane and said, “Take the plane up by yourself.” Soloing is one of the important flights as there is only one of those. I was shocked that he wanted me to go alone, but as soon as I got off the ground, I found out it was much easier, especially not having someone watching over you. When I landed, he marked me 2 for both landings and takeoffs. My hours at that time were 7 hours and 40 minutes, which was fairly fast.

I was at Mt Pleasant 3 months, and it is difficult to remember what we did to pass the time. One night the cadets decided to sneak out the ground floor window after bed check at 9 o’clock and meet in a bar downtown, which was not far. The only thing is I forgot to wake up and missed all the fun. They wouldn’t let me live that down.

One day with time to spare me and Magel went to a bar downtown and got plastered on a few Tom Collins drinks. On the way back, Magel and I were throwing peanuts in the air trying to catch them in our mouth, and the Officer in charge of our group caught us, and we had to clean the dorm for a week, and that was unbecoming of a future officer. He was a 90-day wonder and somewhat of a nerd.

I didn’t know it then, but flying the Piper Cub was quite an honor, especially today. It was almost like a glider. Miles from the field and at 2000 feet, I would pull the throttle all the way back, and it would glide forever. Most of the planes in that day did not have electric power. With the Piper Cub, someone had to spin the propeller to start the engine, hoping not to get hit with the propeller. This was known to happen.

I had only a few hours, and I thought I was pretty good. I was doing wing-over’s and other dumb things... I learned how to slip the plane while landing. Mike, my instructor, caught me doing that and chewed my rear end out. He said I was slipping the wrong direction in relation to the crosswind.

I had to take a check ride with another instructor from time to time, and he would mark us in our log book. The day I had my first check ride was with a guy named Phillips. The wind was blowing at least 20 knots, and in a Piper Cub, that was not good. We had to do Stalls, Spins, Pylon Eights which was flying around two poles on the ground spaced a few hundred feet apart. You had to stay the same distance going around each pole, so you had to adjust the angle of your bank depending in the direction of the wind. The stronger the wind, the more difficult it was. You could always expect a simulated forced landing sometime during the pylon eights. My instructor pulled the throttle back and gave me a force landing, and you are expected to find a field and bring the plane down to almost touching the ground and into the direction of the wind. While you were flying, you had to keep track of the direction of the wind at all times. My first check ride, I passed o.k. but I didn’t get a very good mark.

My instructor would do some crazy things. Another thing he did was landing the plane with extra speed on one wheel and staying on the ground the length of the runway and take off after going the length of the runway. Another time, while I was flying close to the ground, he said I got it and started chasing cows around the fields and going under telephone wires, and that scared the hell out of me, but he was an excellent flyer.

Back at the college, Mike would show up and would hit on about every girl in the place. Some of the instructors got into some trouble with the head people at the college, so they all got together and dive-bombed the college. That did not go over very good.

The word came to us that a cadet at the Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois, had a mid-air collision and was killed. He was from Mt. Pleasant, and the Navy wanted our class to be the pallbearers at his funeral. We did not have dress uniforms at that time, but the Navy got some white uniforms for us to wear, and I was one of the pallbearers. At the funeral, the cadet’s girlfriend was there and went out of her mind. She almost crawled into the casket. I could have disappeared from that funeral very easy. That was the first funeral I had ever attended, but would not be the last.

We finally got our prescribed 40 hours, and I passed the final check ride o.k. The marks were not the best, but they didn’t mark very high then or any time in the future. For some reason, we were not ready to go to our next training station, so we kept on flying to put in our time. We never knew where we were going until the last moment. They told us we were going to the University of Iowa for Pre-flight for 3 months.

I believe they could have done away with the Wooster college, the War Training Service at Mt Pleasant, and the Pre-Flight at Iowa, City, and we would have done just as good. I cannot remember how we traveled to Iowa, City, but I am sure we went by train. Our entire group passed the course O.K. I would like to say that not many navy pilots could say they flew the J-3 Piper Cub in the Navy. That plane is one of my favorite. The instructor and student flew tandem, which is one behind the other. One very good feature of the plane is, while flying from the front seat, you could see the wheels, and later on, when flying the Stearman N-2S bi-plane at Ottumwa, Iowa, you could also see the wheels from the front cockpit. That was always a good feature when landing.

I can not remember the train ride to Iowa. I do know every time I rode the train from Michigan west, it stopped at every city. Riding the train was very enjoyable, and the stops were long enough so you could get off and get something to eat or drink at the train station. Coming into the Dearborn Station was exciting. At the station, you could get a haircut, shoe shine, or other things. There were shops all over and only a few blocks from the center of downtown Chicago. On other longer trips, you could bribe the porters for almost anything. When you arrived at your destination, there would always be a bus or some transportation to get to your base.

## CHAPTER FOUR: The University of Iowa Preflight School, Iowa City, Iowa

When we arrived at the University of Iowa, they put us in a squad of about 50 cadets, and we stayed in the Quadrangle, which was a four-sided building with a courtyard in the center and exits on four sides. It was quite unique. The courses were athletics and academic, but mostly athletics.

All through our training, we had a few special courses that we took until the end of the war. These were navigation, recognition, Morse code, and meteorology. In sports, we had swimming at every base. There was a series of tests for swimming that you tried to pass, and most of the cadets could not pass very many of those. I have a card that shows I passed through triple “AAA” and the survival course. It was difficult for the cadets to pass further than the “C” test.

Besides our academics, we had to go through all of the sports for at least 2 weeks each. These were football, boxing, swimming, and we played pushball, which was with a 6-foot rubber ball. For pushball there were 6 cadets on each team and 6 cadets on the sideline ready to go in when their team got too tired which was about 5 minutes and was as strenuous as soccer. When the game started, 5 players would go around the ball to meet 5 of the other team, leaving one to hold the ball. The only rule was when you get the guy down, you could not bite him. They had a crutch squad of all the injured and most of them came from push ball.

Another test we had to perform was to find out what kind of shape we were in. There were Doctors who would test us after we would step up and down on a platform at a certain count. This was done for a length of time and afterwards the Doctors would examine us by taking our pulse and blood pressure and seeing how long it took to get back to normal. When I got to Iowa preflight I was tested at 88% and because of the training at Mt. Pleasant, they were only able to keep me at the same percentage, 88%.

We had to pass a swimming test that consisted of jumping off a platform 40 feet high into the pool with our cloths on. Then we had to take our shirt off, tie knots in the sleeve, and show you could use your shirt as a floating device. Next, we had to take our pants off, tie knots in each leg, and also show you could float with the pants. As soon as we put our cloths on the side of the pool, we then had to swim for one hour using each one of the strokes, Side, Brest, back, and the Australian crawl. I passed this test without hardly breathing hard. There were more tests to take in the future. The ones who could not swim, stayed in swimming all the time they were there. No other sports. That’s why the Navy thought swimming was so important. The non-swimmers would paddle around with floating cans on there back, and when they tried to go to the edge of the pool to rest, the instructors would push them away with a long pole with a padded ball on the end. The pool was always full. A good percentage of the cadets could not swim. The reason for that was most everyone lived in the inner city and did not have a chance to learn. Cards for survival showing the number of tests you took was given to us.

My 2 weeks in football was the most fun. I had never played football in high school because I thought I was too light, 145 pounds. Only with my friends on a corner lot somewhere. They supplied us with full equipment and assigned us to a squad and we stayed with them for the 2 weeks. The system they used then was called the “T” formation. This way the Navy was trying to make men out of us, they assigned us positions that we were least expected to play. So I became a fullback. The fullback’s job was the same as a blocking back and you had to lead the running back through the line, just right for a 145-pounder.

When I was about 8 years old, I was playing ball in the street, and while running to first base, the telephone pole, I tripped and hit my face on the sidewalk, breaking one of my front teeth in half and split my lip pretty good. So on one of my blocking assignments, I hit this cadet on his knee and that broke the other front tooth, making them even, so now you couldn’t tell if they were broken.

It so happened that I was supposed to run the obstacle course just after the football workout. I didn’t have time after the football to change my gear, so I had to run the course with full football clothing. The optical course was like most of them, a high wall to climb, and a rope crossing a short length of water. The rope was going downhill so gravity would pull you down.

One of the toughest courses was signaling, which was semaphore and blinker. You had to pass semaphore with 12 words a minute, and blinker 10 words a minute. The semaphore was easier then blinker. They would not send you messages that you could understand, but letters all mixed up. They knew that it was easier when you could understand the message. 12 words a minute was fairly fast, but the blinker was very difficult. At 10 words a minute, it looked like it was a steady light. If you were doing badly in either one, they would restrict you to the base for the weekend. One sailor instructor could take 25 words a minute. When he finished the message, he still had about 5 letters to write down. Later on in instrument flying, there were only 2 letters that we had to know for sure. They were an “A” and “N”, and even today I know what they are in Morse code.

Another sport was boxing. All of our instructors were specialists in their instruction, and probably came from coaching in college. For 2 weeks they taught us the fine art of boxing. We all wore head gear. Some of the cadets were very good and had experience in civilian life. One of my friends by the name of Rhodes, who was with us at Mt Pleasant was a light heavy weight boxer and could beat anyone. After 2 weeks they gave us a final test. They paired us with some one who was about the same weight. The instructor told me and my opponent to forget everything he taught us, no holds bared and the one who drew the most blood would be the winner. They just wanted to see a good fight. In my fight, the cadet knocked me done once, and I knocked him down once. Only one round, and when we were through, the instructor told us we had a damn good fight.

Every Sunday would be parade day. Parents and relatives would come from all over the United States for our march to the parade ground which was every Sunday. We would muster in our dress uniforms and march to the parade ground in order of our length of stay at the school. On the parade ground, we would line up with the group that was about to leave being first in line and the newest would be in the back. There were 10 regiments, and being last sure made you feel like you were never going to leave. When we marched to the parade ground, on Sunday, a full navy band would lead the way. It was very stirring. In the evening, the band would play music in the center of the quadrangle, and there was never a lack of talent. There were professionals all over the place.

Gerald Nichols was at the preflight the same time as I was. One day we borrowed a camera and took pictures of each of us. We put on the white dress jacket for the picture. Gerald was ahead of me about a month. I was sure sorry when he left and I was still there. He went to N.A.S. Glenview, Ill. for primary training and that is the reason he ended up at the west coast and was sent to combat.

The preflight school at Iowa had one of the best football teams in the nation. Most of the cadets were college graduates, and the school had a number of all-Americans. They also had the best college coaches in the nation. The football team was called the Seahawks and played all of the major colleges, Ohio State, Michigan, Alabama. My roommate, Bob Sloan who was at Mt. Pleasant was on the team for a while until he was injured. My other roommate was John McNulty who WAS a 4.0 student. He applied for lighter-than-air training at N.A.S. Lakehurst. Only the top of the class would have a chance to get into that school. I never saw him again or heard about him after that.

We did a lot of marching and had to take turns leading the group and calling out cadence. When we came to a hill, we had to carry one of the cadets on our back up the hill. We stayed with the same guys in our group for all 3 months. Our leader was a great guy. All of them were Lt. and were 90-day wonders.

The city of Iowa was only a couple of blocks away and we used to go there on our small time off. The city was small but very nice. Most of our athletics were done in the field house which was Hugh. It had a dirt floor and it was so big that you could play football in it. They would set up almost any kind of sport there. You could kick a football and not have to worry about hitting the ceiling. We would also attend Sunday church service there, and it would hold all of the 1000 cadets with no trouble.

The head of the preflight school was Captain Harahan, who was in WW1. The preflight school at the University of Iowa was just one of many preflight schools. There was a school at St Mary’s college California, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Athens, Ga. Del Monte, California.

When I got my order to the next place, I was at the time very disappointed. We knew that we were going to a primary base, sometimes called the elimination base to learn to fly the N2S-3 Stearman bi-plane. I was hoping it would be a long way from Iowa City to enjoy a long trip on the train, but my orders were to go to the N.A.S. Ottumwa, Iowa was just a short distance by bus. As it turned out it was one on the best stations in the Navy.

## CHAPTER FIVE: Naval Air Station, Ottumwa, Iowa

I would like to say that the previous 9 months at the college Wooster, Ohio, the learning to fly at Mt. Pleasant, and the preflight training at the University of Iowa was not necessary. We could have started at the primary bases learning to fly the bi-plane and accomplished just as much. If I had enlisted a year before I did, all of the training would have been done at N.A.S. Pensacola.

At Pensacola, you trained at the main original base and went through about 5 stages and were then designated a naval aviator. You didn’t travel all over the country to different bases which represented the same training done at Pensacola. The maximum time to finish was about 12 months. At Pensacola you started out flying the bi-plane Stearman or the N3N bi-plane made at the Naval Aircraft Factory. The N-3N was a lot like the Stearman, but was an older plane. That plane was also used as a float plane. The cadets at Pensacola had to qualify as a seaplane pilot, which was not required in my training. I wish I had gone through some of that training.

When we arrived at Ottumwa, they put us in a group of 3 cadets and we stayed together until the end of the training at Ottumwa. I can’t remember the names of the other two in my group. Being in a group made it more interesting to see how each one of us did, and we chummed around together. My instructors name was Lt. Shea and was really a nice guy, not one of the jerks who thought he was the best pilot in the Navy.

They assigned us to a barracks and there were double-decker beds. The guy next to me wet the bed every night. They had to have the lower bunk and the mattress was straw. I can’t believe the navy would put up with that.

The air station was located in the country and was surrounded by corn fields. If you were going to make a forced landing, the corn field would be a good place to land, if you couldn’t find an open field. The air base had two landing or takeoff fields and they were huge mats. The tower was located in the center of the two fields. You would take off on one of the fields and land on the other. That would not be the same every day. Sometimes you would have a right-hand landing pattern, and sometimes a left-hand pattern. You would look at the light in the center of tower, if it was green, it would be a left-hand pattern and red for a right. The way I remembered it was red started with an R which meant right hand.

When you came in for a landing, you did not follow in tandem. You landed with planes on the right side and left side. There could be six or seven planes landing side by side, and you had to really watch out for a crash. The 3 months I was there, I can’t remember an accident in the traffic pattern, except one at night and that was the only fatality in the 3 months, pretty good record. That was not to happen in the future.

My first flight was very interesting. One of the cadets told me to wiggly the stick and he makes a motion like I would like to have him do some acrobatics. That is what I did and before you knew it, I was on my back and the gosport tubes and I was hanging from the seat belt and then he did loops, slow rolls, spins and all of tricks he knew. They loved to take people up and try to make them get sick, especially the waves. Because I already knew how to fly somewhat, it only took about 2 hours, and I was going up alone. That was a pretty good feeling.

There were 5 stages you had to go though, A, B, C, D, and E. The first Stage, (A) was to show you the area, the traffic pattern and all the necessary things to get in and out of the field, and more basic flying. This didn’t take long. The average flight time to solo was about 10 hours. Most of the cadet came to primary straight from pre-flight school and they had no flight time at all. I believe my group was the first to arrive from WTS where we learned to fly the piper cub, so one flight and we soled. The Stearman’s we flew were N2S-3 and had 7 cylinder engines and were painted yellow. Some people called them the yellow pearl, but that was not true. The plane called the yellow pearl was the N3N make by the naval aircraft factory which dated back to ww1.

Other things you did in stage A were learning the flying rules and air discipline, ground indoctrination, instruction in take-offs and landings, taxing, and stalls and spins. One of the rules was if the temperature was below 10 degrees we would not have to fly. Stage B was refining pilot skills. He received instruction in steeply banked turns, precision landings, wing-over’s, and emergency landings. He also learned S-turns to circles or slips to a landing, banking against the wind to control landing of the plane. Most of the stage B took place over auxiliary fields located within a twenty-mile radius of the naval air station. When giving check rides for these maneuvers, check pilots always observed students from the ground.

Stage C was acrobatics. During stage C, the cadet received instruction in any maneuvers not necessary to normal flight. Some of the maneuvers were the loop, slow rolls, Immelman turns, and the regular spin, and also the inverted spin. The difference between the regular spin and the inverted spin was, the regular spin, the gravity was pushing you toward the seat and reverse for the inverted spin. If you didn’t have your seat belt on during the inverted spin, you would be shot right out of the airplane. Other maneuvers were the snap roll, the split S, and the falling leaf.

When I was trying to qualify for the landings in a 200-foot circle, both straight and also during an S turn, my instructor told me how I could cheat by coming in like you were going to be short of the circle and just before you got to the circle you added just a touch of the throttle, not enough for the check instructor on the ground to notice. One of the things the check instructor told us was if you were short the first try, you better be long on the next one. I made all kinds of landings, some in the circle and most of them outside of the circle.

We knew if we passed we would be going into stage D and E, which was mostly formation flying in a flight of 3. Up till then, you were flying from the back seat. After you landed at the end of your circle landings, the instructor would talk to you on the ground. The indication that you passed the test was when you got in the plane to go back to the main field, and the instructor got in the back seat and you in the front, which meant you were qualified for formation flying. My instructor got up on the plane and was putting his leg in the front seat, which was not good. As he did this, he stopped half way, turned to me and said, get in the front seat. What a relief. Flying the Stearman from the front seat was really good, as you could see the front wheels, which make the landing easier.

On one of my check rides, I took off and performed the necessary things without a word from the instructor for the entire hour. When we landed he gave me a down which was flunking and said I left the traffic pattern at the wrong altitude. I was supposed to leave at 300 feet, as the incoming traffic was coming in the traffic pattern at 800 feet. When you got a down you had to fly two check rides and pass both of them or you were out. I was correct in my altitude, but there was no chance to protest. I passed both check rides o.k. and my main instructor said I got the best mark from one of the toughest check instructors.

My instructor Lt. Shea took all 3 of us to his apartment for dinner, and I noticed he had a beautiful wife. The primary course was also called the elimination base because this is where they determined if you were qualified to go on further in your training. Also, this is where they decided what kind of pilot your were going to be, Dive Bomber, Sea plane pilot, Torpedo bomber pilot, multi-engine pilot, fighter pilot, or observation.

Another very dumb thing that I did was when we were going to take our test for recognition. I knew all the airplanes very good. The test consisted of viewing 40 airplanes on a screen showing one at a time at a 1/75 of a second. One of the cadets got a copy of the test in advance and passed the answers to all of us, which were at least 30 cadets. When they started the test, we compared the views with our cheat sheet, and if they were correct, and we turned in our prepared test. We were almost graduating and the ones who got the best score were going to get 3 extra days leave. They never found out about what we did, and I did get 3 extra days leave. If we were caught, we would have been kicked out of the program. Cheating was a very dumb thing to do. I still don’t like to think about it, as I didn’t have to do that to pass. They should have caught us as it would look suspicious, 30 cadets getting a perfect score. I guess when you are young you get caught up into things like that.

When I was checked out for night flying, the instructor took you up and showed you what to do. I still remember my instructor, Lt Nielson. On our ride he let me take the controls and would say, start your turn here, do this, do that, but no way was he going to let me do it by myself. I don’t blame him, but I still had to do the night flying by myself. The only fatality was during night flying. One of the cadets landed on top of another plane.

My instructor and I were coming back from
Okay, continuing with the next chunk of Markdown output, picking up directly from the previous completion:

one of my day time flights when my instructor got into a dog fight with another instructor and his cadet. We were flying at about a thousand feet. They went round and round and I never felt so many “G” forces. Some of the instructors thought they were pretty good. The instructors were upset, not being able to go further in the program and to combat. The instructors usually were civilian pilots who went through an accelerated instructor courses.

I was told that some of the cadets would chase the trains and try to touch the top of the engine with one of their wheels. You know there would be a cadet that would try that.

One of my friends was doing some acrobatics, a slow roll. You had to pull back on the stick very fast, push to the right, or left, and then neutralize the controls. When you did one to the left, your arm would go across the lever to unhook your seat belt. My friend Ray Lynch did this and his seat belt came loose and he ended out of the plane lying on top of the fuselage. He dove back in head first into the cockpit and from then on he wired the belt so they wouldn’t come loose. There were a number of guys who fell out of the plane and were saved by the parachute. You were supposed to hang on the part you pulled to open the chute.

One of my flights was to learn to do slow rolls. My instructor told me all you had to do was push the sick to the left or right; half way around you would push the sick forward to keep the plane level. We did this to the right for a half hour and coming back to the base to the left for the other half hour. That seemed easy enough, but later on in my training I found out I was doing barrel rolls instead of a slow roll. A slow roll you used all of the controls, including the rudders which would keep the plane in straight line, much more difficult than the slow roll. I guess my instructor thought it was too difficult and took the easy way out.

Most of the cadets went through the whole program with out any trouble, but I seemed to run into trouble all of the time. When I was going through primary, there was still a need for naval aviators, but later on, I heard because the war was coming to a close, the wash out got as high as 50%. I read an article by Ted Williams who became an instructor after his training at Pensacola and they told him to wash out more cadets. His reply was if they are good pilots, he would not wash them out. Ted Williams was training at Pensacola the same time that I was. There are a couple of stories I will tell later.

I was at Ottumwa during the winter, so we wore the heavy flying suits and it was difficult to get in the plane with all that gear. It was so cold that we wore face masks.

The farmers complained that the cadet would try to take the tops of the corn off by flat-hatting, or flying low. There were stories of instructors and the cadet making forced landings in a corn field and could not take off, so they would taxi back and forth cutting the corn down to make a runway and then take off and return to base.

Another thing the cadets did was flying over the Mississippi river upside down. The engine would cut out while you flew upside down, but as soon as you turned the plane right side up, the engine would start again. During the months I was there, there were a total of 800 cadets, which would mean that at least 70 cadets would leave to go to Pensacola, Jacksonville, Miami, or Corpus Christi every week. Multiply that by all the other primary bases and there were hundreds going for advance training. I heard a figure of 25,000 naval aviators graduated from Pensacola by the end of the war including the very first who graduated in 1914.at Pensacola Before the war. Pensacola was the only place to become a naval aviator then.

The weather at Ottumwa was very cold, mostly between 10 and 20 above zero. One day, both the landing mats were covered with a sheet of ice that happened while I was in the air. Just as I touched down while landing, a plane beside me did a complete 360 spin on the ice. It was no trouble for either of us as we just kept going straight till we slowed down.

When I first arrived at Ottumwa, the planes were colored yellow. This color is the reason they were called the yellow peril. The speed we cruised at was about 90 knots and we would climb and glide at 65 knots. Because of the construction of the plane, you could do any kind of acrobatics and you would not have to worry about the wings coming off. One of the most strenuous was the progressive spin. You started out by pulling the nose straight up, letting the plane go into a spin. Just after you entered the spin you started to recover, but before you did, you hit opposite rudder and pulled back on the stick which would make you go into a spin in the opposite direction. You did this 3 of 4 times before you finally came out of the spin. The “G” force was tremendous.

## CHAPTER SIX: Training at N.A.S. Pensacola, Florida - The Annapolis of the Air

We left NAS Ottumwa, Iowa after a 3-day leave. I did not know where I would be going. They never told us ahead of time. Those cadets who were successful in completing all stages of primary flight training were ready to go on to intermediate training school at Corpus Christi or Pensacola. I was lucky to be picked to go to Pensacola, where the original Navy pilot trained.

A group of us boarded a train for the trip to Pensacola. Most of the cadets were aggressive and full of piss and vinegar, so on the way, they got some whiskey and bribed the conductor to leave the bunks down, so we could sleep any time we wanted to. A little money also helped. You can imagine that it was one party all the way.

After one stop in St. Louis, we arrived at the train station in Pensacola. We boarded the same old cattle cars to get to the air station. Walking through the gates at Pensacola was quite a feeling, just knowing of all the naval aviators who passed through those gates. I thought naval aviation had been around for ages while in 1944 it was only 30 years from the beginning. Now as I type this, 60 years have gone by and soon it will be 100 years, but I will be in the grave. The base dates before the Civil War and was called The Navy Yard. And later, it was called the N.A.S. Pensacola, Florida.

We spent one week for indoctrination at the main air station where before 1942, all the training was done there in 5 phases, the same as our training at different bases around the United States. The main air station is located just 15 minutes from downtown Pensacola and is called the “The Annapolis of the air”. The station dates to 1914 for the first Naval Aviators beginning with the naval aviator # 1 Theodore G. Ellyson who got his wings, March 4th, 1913.

While at the main station, they took pictures of us and assigned us to a group number or class number. After we were there about a week, we were transferred to the naval air station, Ellyson field, which was not that far from the main air station. They put us in the usual barracks, 2 to a room. I remember my roommates name was Navare who was from Lansing, Michigan. We were also put in a group of 3 cadets for our flying and I don’t remember the names of any of them. The plane we were to fly was the SNV-3 Vultee Vibrater. The plane had a 450HP engine and a non retractable landing gear. The Propeller was a 2 stage prop, which were either full pitch or low pitch and nothing in between.

The first part of the training at Pensacola was flying around, getting use to the new plane. I remember that when landing you had to be careful as the plane floated a long ways and one good thing was the landing gear was wide apart, which made it more difficult to ground loop. You took off in low pitch and after you got up to about a 1000 feet you put the prop in high pitch, which would be like rowing a boat with the oars straight up and down.

There was no such thing as soloing a plane, you just got in and took off, and that was the way from then on. When you were in your barracks and the planes were taking off, as they used low pitch, the noise was so laud you couldn’t hear anything. In the morning when you didn’t have anything to do, it was impossible to sleep. The windows would shake.

All through the training the system was the same. You went out to the flight line to look for your name on a large blackboard. Also to find out whom you were going to fly with. You got so you knew who the easy instructors were, and we called then Santa Claus. I remember my main instructors name was Collins and was a very nice guy. When you were coming back to the field, there was a certain place the instructors would turn off the gas. When your engine cut off in an emergency, there was a certain procedure or check off you went through. I knew the spot this would happen and would have my hand on the gas lever for the turn off and as the instructor turned it off, I would turn it on right away. Sometimes the instructor would get a laugh out of that.

After we had a few hours, we started flying in a 3 plane formation. We practiced cross over’s and switching around to different positions At this base is where you were to decide if you wanted to be a navy, marine corps, or coast guard pilot. I only wanted to be a navy pilot, but my room mate wanted to be a Marine Pilot. I told him the only reason was he wanted to be in the marines was to wear the Sam Brown Belt. He sold me his cadet uniforms as you could convert them to Navy officer’s uniforms when you graduated.

We were not going to be at Ellyson field very long and I finished with 20 hours flight time. Our next base would be Whiting Field, located near Milton, Florida, not very far away. This is where we would learn to fly on instruments in an SNJ which was a 650 H.P. engine with retractable landing gear and constant speed propeller. Constant speed meaning, when you set the R.P.M, such as at 2000 R.P.M it would stay at that speed.

Ted Williams was taking basic the same time as I was and every time he did something stupid, the news would put it in the paper. They dressed him up in a uniform for pictures, but put his shoulder boards on backwards. The cadets had a copy of that on all of the bulletin boards. He became a marine flyer and after graduating, he became an instructor for a couple of years at Pensacola. Later on when the war was coming to a close, the navy would start washing cadets out for no reason. Being an instructor is why he never saw combat in ww11, but did in Korea.

When it became time for our final check, our instructor Collins met us in the hanger and told us we had already passed and to go up and have a good time. He said I will be around watching. You would see him from time to time. That is the only time this happened to me, pretty good for a change. My log book shows I went up with an instructor only 6 times.

The city of Pensacola was located about 15 minutes from the main station and airfield. The downtown city was very beautiful with a center section of trees and grass going the length of the main street.

Okay, completing the transformation into Markdown format. Here are the last few chapters:

## CHAPTER SEVEN: Instrument Flying at N.A.S. Whiting Field Pensacola

The last flight at Ellyson field was Feb. 5th 1943 and my first flight at whiting field was March 3rd 1943, so you see an entire month went bye doing nothing. That is the reason it took so long to finish at Pensacola.

The weather was very bad during my training at Whiting field, seems like a storm went bye every day. The name for the instrument training is called the low frequency range. There is a tower that sends out a signal in a certain area that consists of 4 quadrants with a beam of sound in 4 legs, like a road for driving. In between each quadrant there are 2 radio signals. One is an A and the other is a B. All of this branches out from the tower and one mile from the tower is the field, so if you locate where you are in the air, you can navigate to the field.

We would have classes showing us how to do this and we also got 25 hours in a link trainer and these were operated by women waves. This is how you learned to fly when the weather was bad. When actual flying, the instructor would put you in one of the 4 quadrants. You would have a hood over you head so you could not see out and all the flying would be done by instruments. When the instructor put you in an area, he would say it is all yours and you would have to take him to the field while under the hood. When you got to the field you would tell the instructor that you were over the field and he would open the hood and you better be over the field or you were in trouble. This method was used by the air lines all over the world and I can’t believe there were not more accidents, as every one was going down the same beam or road.

When you were following the beam and you passed over the intersection of the 4 beams, the sound of the beam, a steady hum would disappear and you knew you were over the radio station. There was a procedure for letting down to the 8oo foot altitude and you had to recognize this. From there you were one mile to the field.

On one of my flights my instructor put me in an area real close to the cone of silence. I went through the cone, recognized it and let down and got to the field with out going down a beam to get there. That would be like getting a hole in one in golf. When we landed the instructor said I was lucky and flunked me, so I had to fly two check rides to pass. I did not get a bad instructor for the check rides and had no trouble and I passed both of the o.k. I am sure there were cadets that went through training who did not have any trouble at all.

In the barracks we had double-decker beds and I had one on the upper level. One night I woke up and the room was full of smoke and there was a fire next to the bed reaching as high as where I was sleeping. The guy in the lower bunk was smoking and fell asleep. His cigarette fell into his clothes on the floor and set the place on fire. The flames were reaching all the way to the ceiling. You should have seen us move.

There were two fields at Whiting and we used one of them. The other field was used to train multi-engine pilots for instruments. I asked one of the instructors if I could go on one of their flights as a passenger and watch the training for one of the cadets. They used a different method of navigation on their flights. This instructor chewed the cadet’s ass out form the time we took off till we landed. I felt sorry for the cadet. No way would I have picked that type of course.

We also had to learn to use the bubble octant. We had to get a fix on 3 different stars and using a table in a book, we could figure where we were. That took some time and traveling at 200 miles an hour, you would not be able to do it fast enough. It would work if you were on a ship out to sea.

When I reported for one of my classes in the link trainer I felt a little tired and told the woman wave that I was tired. She said get in the trainer and go to sleep and she would cover for me. I ended up with 25 hours of training in the link trainer and one hour of sleep.

I was there from March 3rd to May 30TH and flew 51.6 hours which was not much for two months. In the total time at Whiting field I only went up with the instructor two times.

When the airline pilots were using the low frequency range from city to city, they knew where they were and where they were going, not like the cadet who had to find out by certain procedure where they were. If they were in San Francisco, going to Los Angles, they had a map of the western United States and would follow the beam from the San Francisco radio station going to L.A. and would transfer to the radio station in L.A. Every city would have a radio station. The beams all had a number of degrees on the map, so the Airline pilot was not completely in the dark. The FAA changed the system to an instrument call Omni in later years. This was a gage that would tell you the direction straight to the city instead of a radio station to radio station and this opened up the entire area. If J.F.K had some of this training, he would be alive today, and many other beginning pilots.

We finally finished at Whiting field and our next step was to go to the main station Pensacola where we would go through more training, but no flying. Some of the things we were going to do were to take a trip in the Dilbert dunker which is a cockpit of an airplane that was on a high track above a swimming pool and learn how to get out of a sinking plane in the water. We would also be taken up in pressure chamber to 30,000 feet and do some tests there. When I was a kid I listened to Jack Armstrong on the radio and he was always flying the beam. This method did not last long. We would spend about a week at NAS Pensacola before we went on to the final stage of flying.

## CHAPTER EIGHT: Preparing for Combat

When we arrived at the main station Pensacola, they put us up in the same old wooden barracks with double-decker bunks. I know we were in a group, but I can’t remember who they were. The base was very large and there was a full hospital, a full size golf course, swimming pools, tennis courts and places to play basketball. All of the bases had teams that played all of the sports, consisting of enlisted sailors, or permanent officers or sailor of the base. The cadets would not play on any of those teams as they moved around to much. The field was named N.A.S. Chevalier after naval aviator number 7 who was a flyer in WW1 and did many of the early tests of flying for the Navy.

The only cadets who flew at the base were the ones who were going to be flying and landing on the water. These were the observation pilots and the flying boat pilots, both 2 engines and 4 engines. A couple of years before this, all cadets learned to fly off the water and all the other phases at this main station.

The station also dates to before the Civil War and was taken over by the Confederates during the war. The base was a navy yard at that time and some of the buildings are still there. The base was one of the largest in the United States and dates to the year of 1550 and was called the Fort San Carlos and is on the N.A.S. Pensacola property. It changed hands from the Spanish to the French and back to the Spanish down through the years. It was captured by the British in 1815 and then returned to the Spanish in 1819. Fort Barrancas was built in 1839 in front of Fort San Carlos. During the Civil War it was captured by the Florida volunteers in 1861 and it was evacuated in 1862. Both Forts are still there and is close to the shore.

We were sent to the main air station to get training in the high altitude chamber and to ride the Dilbert Dunker which was the cockpit of an airplane on a track in the station swimming pool located right on the beach. You would be strapped in the cockpit high up on this track. They would release it and it would slide down the track and crash into the pool and turn upside down and go to the bottom of the pool. Then you would undo your harness and leave the plane. If you would see the movie The Officer and a Gentleman, they used that same method in their training, but was over done as to the risk, It was no big deal. The swimming pool was located in a large building on the beach. I believe they are still using it today.

In between our tests we would go to the horse riding stable. The horses would travel a route around the golf course which was all fenced in. The big trouble was the horses would want to go back to the stables. While you were riding the course, the horses would try to rub you off on the fences. I only rode the horses one time as that was enough.

We played the golf course a couple of times, but I didn’t know what I was doing as I had never played before. The base had a very nice club house, just as well as all of the other facilities. I heard that later on the club house burned down. This is the only base that had that many things to do. All of the other bases were commissioned from 1941 to the then present date. The sailors who were stationed at this base sure had a good deal.

Our next assignment was to the oxygen chamber. This was a very important phase as if something went wrong with the oxygen in the plane you could die within 60 seconds. There were about 12 of us in one group to take the test. They took us to a simulated height of 30,000 feet. We all wore oxygen masks. When we were at the altitude, they asked one of us to volunteer to take your mask off and perform some tests. I was the one to volunteer and looking back I was a little stupid to do this. They gave me a deck of cards and a cardboard box with a slot in it. I was suppose to take a card from the deck, hold it up, name it and put it in the slot of the box. I can remember naming about 2 cards when I woke up. All of the cadets were laughing. I guess I started to throw the cards around the chamber. It took only about 15 seconds before I passed out. In later years, there were cases of planes who lost there pressurization and their oxygen. You don’t know this is happening and the people in the planes died. This is what happened to Payne Stewart the golfer.

The next test in the chamber was to let us simulate a free fall from the 30,000 feet to sea level. If some of the guys would get an ear ache, they would stop the descent. We knew if this happened to us we would suffer the pain and not tell anyone for this would wash you out of the program. I was lucky as I had no trouble.

From this point on will be the most exciting and will be more danger. I was trying to show some pictures, but was having trouble installing them, so at the end of this story, I will print all of the pictures and tell where they will go in order. There will have to be a lot of editing as there are a lot of mistakes in spelling and grammar. When I graduate I will be coming back to this air station. And to be designated a Naval Aviator. We will get our commission and wings from the commandant and admiral of the station.

## CHAPTER NINE: Advanced Training N.A.S. Barin Field Pensacola

From Whiting field we will be going to the N.A.S. Barin field located in Foley, Alabama, just across the border of Florida. This is the station where we will graduate as a fighter pilot. Barin field was called Bloody Barin. This came about through the newspaper icon Drew Pearson who said he would rather send his son to any where in war area than to a certain field at Pensacola. The casualty rate at this field was pretty high. The Navy invited him to come down to the field and see, but he refused. I remember there were caskets piled up quite high beside one of the hangers. There was a story about why so many pilots got killed and this was when the cadets were coming back from the main station, Pensacola from the weeks leave all drunked up and were killed in auto accidents. Barin field was about 30 minutes from downtown Pensacola. I don’t thing this was true, but a good story.

We got to the air station the same old way, the cattle cars and we were assigned three to a room and also put in a flight of 6 and would be with them for the entire training. I can only remember 3 of them. The base had 2 fields and there was a proper way to leave the field and return and if you didn’t do this right, you would be in trouble. On the ground there were pylons that you had to follow that made you follow in one line, not like in primary where you came in to the field with many planes side by side. This was a good way to keep the accident rate down. Later on I got into trouble with this traffic pattern. This base was the second largest auxiliary base of the six out lying fields at Pensacola.

The planes we were to fly were the same as at Whiting field, and there we always flew duel. We just got in the plane and took off and that was the way it was from then on. The base was located not far from the ocean. A lot of our flying was over water, such as gunnery and navigation. I flew a total of 80 hours at Barin field and went up with an instructor only 2 times. We always flew in a flight of 6 and if we needed to be tested, an instructor flew with us in his own plane. All the marks he gave us were from watching us from a distance and I don’t know how they did that.

The first training we did was flying around in formation with an instructor following us in his plane. We were marked for every flight and a 3.0 was a good mark which converts to a 75%. For some reason the instructors did not think we were good enough for anything better and 2.5 was passing. If you got less than 2.5 three times you would have to go before Navy board and they would decide if you could go on. This happened to all 6 of us at the same time while we were in gunnery and you know that they decided to get rid of some of us. Again we had to fly two passing flights to continue, which we did. Of the 6 of us, they washed out one of us. I remember what he looked like and he was in shock and couldn’t believe it. He broke down pretty good as it was only 2 weeks from graduation. I know that they picked him like drawing from a hat.

Ten Williams who was at Pensacola the same time as I was and they make him an instructor. The Navy told him to start washing out more cadets as the Navy knew the war was coming to a close and pilots were not needed as much. He told the navy that if the cadet was a good pilot, he would not wash him out. But I am getting ahead of myself.

We still went to classes for navigation, meteorology, recognition, and instruction in gunnery to learn the different methods for shooting at the sleeve. We took turns towing the sleeve, which was still the most dangers flying you could do. There were certain methods you had to follow for navigation. One of the flights we took was over the water we were to fly 3 100 mile segments over the water like a triangle and finishing at the field. We had a plotting board in the instrument panel that we could plot the course we were to take. They gave us a sealed envelope with the instructions for the direction of the 3 segments. That could be in any direction. We had to plot this on the navigation board and this was done while we were flying in a 3 plane formation. Try that sometime. What we did was pull apart a short distance while we did the plotting.

I lucked out pretty good. When I took off to join up with the other planes, I was unable to retract my landing gear, so I had to go back to the base. The other 2 cadets had to finish the course. Lucky for me as the 2 cadet got lost and ended up at a field in Mississippi. They didn’t get in any trouble for that and I never did take my test.

I flew 46 flights at Barin Field and at no time did I fly the same plane twice. There were that many planes at the field and I would guess at least 200 airplanes. This type of plane, the SNJ Texan was used in almost all of the training, both in the air corps and Navy.

One of the many things that happened to me was entering the traffic pattern. I thought I was pretty good so in following the pylons I would go around them pretty steep, somewhat like a hot dog style. When I got back to the base I had a note to report to this instructor. He told me I cut him off going around a pylon. I had no recognition that this happened. The instructor had me clean airplanes for a week No argument. Still that is the only trouble I got into for that.

The test we had for acrobatics with out any instruction form the instructors was to fly above the field at 3000 feet and perform the required acrobatics. We were flying solo and the instructors were setting in chairs on the ground watching us. I don’t know how they could tell who was what, as there were a number of planes doing the acrobatics the same time. I don’t think they knew what I was doing. That was O.K. by me. I said before, there was not enough instruction in groups for what you were required to do. This procedure was done many years before my training.

There was not a whole lot to do at the base, except hang out at the lounge for drinks etc. You could stay in your room and listen to the radio. One of the cadets in my room was training to be a singer and most of the time he would be practicing his voice lessons. My other roommate and I got pretty tired of that. Again they were mostly older than me. There were also dances on the week end and they would invite all the girls form the whole area.

I would go into downtown Pensacola on the short weekend they would give up, by bus. If you were standing on the street down town Pensacola, there would be so many cadets, you could hardly walk around. I would see some or the cadet I trained with in other stations and everybody would ask when you are going to get your wings. Of all the ones I knew, not any of them were taking the fighter course. Most of them were in multi-engine or flying boats and most of them were further along than me. I was in the training that I wanted to be in. To make landings on a carrier was the only way to go. This was naval aviation.

The gunnery phase was the most difficult. I think I got the most hours in this phase. One of us would tow a sleeve of nylon on the back of cable about 200 feet long. It was difficult to take off with the sleeve. We held the brakes of the plane, reviled the engine to full power, released the brakes, pulled the plane off as quickly as we could and go straight up to about 500 feet and dump the nose and hope you would not stall out. Enlisted sailors held the sleeve in the air and if we did it right, the sleeve would not touch the runway. The other 5 cadets would follow the tow plane to the area over the golf for the target area. One of us would take turns leading the flight and radio the other cadet which type of run we would do. There were 3 types, the over head, the high side, and one where you would come underneath the sleeve called the low side. All of our approaches were from about 1000 about the tow plane and at least half mile in front of the tow plane. We would be in a right echelon and peel off one at a time for our run with a proper interval. An example with the overhead, we would turn so we were flying right over the opposite direction of the tow plane and at the proper moment we go inverted and dive at the sleeve so that we would be able to sight ahead of the sleeve and correct for the speed of the tow plane. If you inverted too late you would not be in position to shoot the sleeve. And if you inverted too soon, you could hit the sleeve. To hit the sleeve was quite difficult and In order to pass you had to get a score of at least 5%. We also would have to pass the sleeve at a 70 degree angle or steeper. This was done so if you were shooting at a plane, they would have a tough time firing at you. The quicker you got out of there was better. The interval of each plane had to be far enough apart so that you would not be shooting the pilot ahead of you. We would join up in an echelon after every run and start the next. While we were doing this an instructor would be floating around watching us and that is how he would mark you.

I forgot to mention when taking the sleeve off, if we didn’t get it off soon enough, it would drag on the runway and tear it apart. If that happened we would drop it in the drop area, land and do it all over again. This did not make everyone happy.

One day when I went to the plane assigned to me I noticed a hole in each side of the propeller. The gun, a 30 caliber was positioned on top of the coiling and would shoot the bullets through the propeller area. There was a synchronization that allowed the bullets to miss the propeller. If something went wrong and you shot the prop, the mechanic would drill a hole in the other blade to balance the prop. The bullets were painted with different colors so you would know how many hits each pilot got. There are 8 colors and there was always a fight over blue and purple. A copy of the each write up by the instructor is in my flight jacket. The flight jacket is a file with a copy of all my orders and marks from every station from primary to the end. Later on I will tell some of the marks and why I got them.

One day as I started to taxi to the flight line and I hit another plane with my wing. The damage to the planes was just a little bit too each wing tip, nothing to get excited over. This was written up in my flight jacket.

On one of the gunnery flights which I was leading, I had a very close call. We were going out to the Area and our flight of 5 were weaving back and forth so we would not go faster than the tow plane, when what happened is slightly dim in my memory. I was turning the flight in one direction and the tow plane turned into our area at the same altitude. As we were turning, one of our planes hit the cable with his antenna wire which was a wire stretched from the banner to the back of the cockpit and only about a foot about the fuselage. The plane that hit the wire turned over and went plunging toward the ground. You can’t believe what went through my mind. Whose fault it was I do not know. I watched him going down and finally he came out of the dive and joined up with us again and that ended the flight for that day. A foot closer and the cable could have ripped the plane in two pieces, not to mention what it would have done to the tow plane. It was a matter of inches between life and death. Nothing was said of this accident and I lucked out there. I remember the cadet who hit the wire to this day. Later on he had another accident.

It was during this gunnery phase that the instructors gave all of a down or a failing mark. For one of us to get a failing mark makes sense, but all of us at the same time was not correct. The instructor said we were not going by the sleeve at less then 70 degrees and again he was wrong. I went by so steep, almost vertical for this gunnery run and we all had to go before the captains board who decided if we could go on or flunk out. They gave 5 of us extra time, except one we had to take two flight checks and we all passed them except the cadet that was washed out. At the Captains board, if you look in my flight jacket, which I have the original of; you can see the failing marks which are all written in red. With some of the things that happened to me, I was lucky to get though. Again I knew guys that didn’t have one bit of trouble.

After graduation and further on I had quite a few more problems and most of my officers in my squadron also. One of the officers on the captain’s board was a Lt. Bruffey who was in my squadron. After the war, Lt. Bruffey was killed in a jet accident.

My twin brother visited me at Barin field and I got my instructor on one of the gunnery hops to take him up to watch us. When the instructor went by us I could see my brother waving at me like he was having a ball. Maybe this helped me to get through the training, who knows? I was sure happy when this stage was over with.

I had 7 flights at night and all we did was flying around in a flight of 3. Just flying around with no destination is more difficult than flying from one point to and other. You could plot the course and the time to get there and back. I still don’t know how we got back to the field, but we did. They gave us no instruction in what could happen, flying at night. It was very easy to get what they called vertigo. This is when you would lose your ability to tell if you were going down or up. I do know that if you stared at the lights to much, this could happen. The way you could stop that is to look at the lights on the wings for only a short time and look away and then back again. Doing this for an hour is hard to do. There was a green light on the end of the left wing, and red light on the right wing. One night at about 3 in the morning, they got all of up and mustered in front of the barracks and took a roll count. The reason for that was there were 2 flyers missing and they were trying to fine them. The navy said they must have gotten vertigo night flying and flew right into the ground in formation. Night fighters are one of the groups you could apply for, but this was not for me. I had some trouble later on night flying, but will talk about that later.

There were 2 stages left before we would graduate. They were dive bombing and fighter combat against an instructor. For the dive bombing stage we were to drop 25 bombs at a target in the water, which were 4 pylons in a square and one pylon in the middle located in the water. The total distance of the target across the target could be about 50 feet. We would do this from a 3 plane formation and drop one bomb at a time, so it took quite a while to drop 25 bombs. I was really lucky to get 12 bull eyes out of the 25 which was a lot more than I needed. One of the guys, the same one who hit the tow plane, didn’t pull out soon enough and crashed in the water. All he got was a bloody face out of that. They didn’t do anything about that to him. You could crack up a plane and they would not flunk you out while if you did some minor thing they would really penalize you. I checked my marks in my flight jacket and the instructor gave me a 3.0. There was no such thing as getting a 4.0, 3.1 were about the highest mark that the instructors gave. I got a 2.7 from a check ride in primary and my main instructor told me I did excellent and that was the highest mark this instructor ever gave out.

For the combat stage, we would meet the instructor in a certain area and we would dog fight and see who the best was. The way it started was the cadet would fly 1000 feet above the instructor and we would be heading straight at each other. The cadet got the advantage by being higher. As soon as I was over the top of the instructor, the fight would begin. As soon as this happened the cadet would turn like you were going to get on the tail of the other plane and losing altitude at the same time. The instructor would turn in the opposite direction and you would be going head on again. As soon as you passed the other plane, one would again turn to get on your tail and this would go on for quite a while until someone make a mistake. Whoever got on the tail of the other one, the fight was over as the rear plane could do anything the other plane could do very easy.

One of my friends gave me some information on how to beat the instructor. He told me as you were heading toward each other at the same altitude, put you flaps down and slow the plane down just above stalling. Just before you are at the same spot and about to pass, you would do a half snap roll just before you got to him, which would put you going the same direction as the instructor before you reached him. but maybe a 100 or 200 feet below him, but going in the same direction, and as we continued I inched my way up to the same altitude as he was and directly behind him and I won the combat. HE wiggled his wings to let me know I had won. Again I checked my flight jacket and all he gave me was a 3.1. That is the highest mark I ever got. That did not seem fair. Because I did so well in the last 2 stages is the reason I finally got through O.K.

Barin field had a firing rifle and machine gun firing range and they wanted us to find out what it was like to fire a 50 caliber machine gun. The machine gun was mounted on a tri-pod and we had to wrap our arms around the gun and hold on for dear life. The fire power was unbelievable.

My last flight was June 19th and my final mark was 2.88 which I was happy with, just as long as I passed. I had my Skipper’s jacket and his final mark was 3.0 or 1.2 better than me. 3.0 were difficult to get.

## CHAPTER TEN: Designation Day

They send me to the main air station for graduation. It took 9 days to finally get to the day of graduation, and in the mean time, me and some of my friends would play golf and other things. They gave me 150.00 dollars to buy my uniforms. I went into downtown Pensacola to one of the tailors to get fitted. I can’t remember which one. When they measured me for the green uniform, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I also bought 3 pairs of wings. In the years of 1939 and before, the Navy presented the wings to you on designation day.

On the day of designation our group of about 300 lined up in front of a brick platform and the Captain and commandant of the base, Rear Admiral H. F. MacComsey gave us our graduation certificate. This was called being designated a naval aviator. I have a postcard that shows the exact spot that we graduated. This platform is right across form what they called Admirals row, where there were about 6 of the most beautiful houses you ever saw. These buildings date to the Civil War.

We had a silver dollar that we would give to the first person to salute us. This was tradition and I believe the custom is still in use. The graduation date was July 28th 1944. The next day we went to administration building to get our orders. I was standing in from of the counter and a wave asked me my name so she could get my orders. While I was in Iowa preflight and resting on the grass, a Corsair came over us about 100 feet high and I said to myself, that is what I want. I never asked anyone for something, but I said to the wave, I sure would like Corsairs at Jacksonville. She left and came back and handed me my orders. I could see a smile on her face and sure enough that I what I got. This is the first time I asked for any thing.

After graduation, everything changed. I was allowed to go to the officers club, and many other things. My salary increase was from 75.00 per month to 300.00 dollars per month and subsistence and a housing allowance. This was a lot of money for that time. What really changed was we stayed in better quarters and no more making beds or taking care of your room. We had mostly black maids, some change.

There is a lot more I could say about the training at Pensacola, like what you did other than flying, but the memory is not so good. The size of the Air Station was really large and today there is another field big enough for flying jets. There is a beautiful museum there and the best in the United States.

## CHAPTER ELEVEN: Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida

After graduation, they sent us to the train station that was downtown Pensacola, where it was located from the beginning. From now on, every time we traveled we would have our orders given to us in a folder with at least 26 copies. Every time you went to a different place, you had to give the Navy a copy of the orders. I have a copy of most of them are in my file.

The trip to N.A.S. Station Jacksonville was a short trip. As far as I know, I was the only one of the 300 who graduated on the 28th of July 1944 at Pensacola to go to NAS Jacksonville. Where the rest of them went I did not know. There were Naval Air Stations at Daytona Beach, Melbourne, Vero Beach, and Miami. The NAS at Miami dates to ww1 and trained Naval Aviator for ww1 and also for Airships called lighter than air. Gerald Nichols went to Daytona Beach to fly the F6F Hellcat and was there the same time I was at Jacksonville. The other bases were for the SBD dive bombers and the TBF torpedo bombers. The ones who went to those bases were picked long before they graduated as I was at Barin field.

You can’t imagine how many airplanes were flying around those bases. The traffic pattern was as dangerous as you could get. The distance from Pensacola to Jacksonville was about 350 miles and would only take a day to get there by train. Traveling on the train was a lot of fun. When you boarded the train, you grabbed any seat that was available. If you had some friends you could arrange the seats so they were facing each other, that way you could have 4 people to set with, or leave the one seat facing forward, Which ever you would want. Because the trains were coal burners, you always had smoke coming in the windows if it were summer time. It sure seemed different and good to be traveling as an officer and as a single person and not in a group, that way you could do what and when you wanted to.

When I arrived at Jacksonville, I went straight to the Naval Air Station and checked in with the duty officer and gave them one of the many orders that I had. They assigned me to one of the officer’s quarters and I was put in a room with one other officer. From now on I did not have to make my bed or muster in a group like as a cadet. We had Black maids who took care of all the cleaning of the building and the rooms. I reported to the administration building to find out what I was going to do and they told me to wait and they would notify me when I was going to start flying. This was about the first of August 1944. From that time until the 30th of august I just sat around and waited for them to notify me.

The Naval Air Station was located on the St Johns River which was about 10 miles from the Atlantic ocean shore, and was on the east side of the river. The base was one of the largest bases in the United States and is at the present time. It was also a few miles south of downtown Jacksonville. Most of the time you took off going west and by the time you were air born you would be going over the St Johns River. The base did not have a lot of athletic provisions, but it did have a very nice pool, not far from our quarters.

I was finally notified that we were going to start flying and they put me in a group of 8 pilots. They were Lt. Richard T. Schaeffer who was our leader and a graduate of the Naval Academy, Lt. Vincent A. Dahlstrom who just came back from combat in the Pacific flying F6F Hellcats and he use to tell us he could cut a large tree down firing his 50 cal. machine guns. He also dressed fancy with high fur lined boots, Lt. Gordon and I didn’t know where he came from; These officers were 27 or 28 years old at that time and had quite a lot of experience. They did not really have to take this training, but I believe they were there to help the rest of us who were brand new. The others were Lt. j.g. Robert P. Brewer who came from Pensacola where he was in instructor and was also 28 years old, Ensign Joseph B. Laduke who was from Flat Rock Michigan, Ensign Percy L. Liles who was from California, Ensign Peter Kantralis who was a Greek, and of course me, Ensign Robert E. McGaffin

. I wish there had been a picture of us as a group but that did not happen. Most of the groups did have there picture taken. The first thing we did was to have training classes to learn all about the F4U Corsair and to learn about the base and the traffic pattern and the area. They set up a mock cockpit of the corsair and we had to learn the instrument panel and we would have a test blind folded, so we knew it very well.

The Corsair did not have an electrical start. We had to use a Kaufman Cartridge which was put in a firing position at the right side of the engine, like a shotgun rifle. When you pressed the starter, the cartridge would fire and turn the prop a few times and you would hope to start the engine that way. Most of the time it took more than one cartridge to start the engine. The planes we were to fly were mostly back from combat and were in the worst of shape. All of them were of the canopy bird cage type. It wasn’t till later that they came out with ignition start and a bubble canopy. We had the same planes all through our training at Jacksonville.

One of the mechanics was a sailor named Al Vandemullen who was on the tennis team at Flint Central High School with me. He had been washed out as a cadet so ended up NAS Jacksonville as a mechanic. He told me he wouldn’t fly those planes for anything because they were in such bad shape. He was transferred to the Carrier, the USS Intrepid and was standing on the deck when a Japanese Kamikaze hit where he was standing and he was killed. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Al had a car in high school and we use to drive it all over the place. In those days a lot of kids had a car.

I was 20 years old at this time. Percy Liles was 22 and Pete Kantralis and Joe Laduke were also 22 years old, leaving me as the youngest.

On my solo flight I was given instruction to taxi the plane around the field for a few minutes and then take off. This was all done with the women waves in the tower giving us instructions, as they had seen this done many times. I had the sequence all figured out. Everything was set in the plane. I had the engine fixed at full mixture, full R.P.M. etc. As soon as you left the ground, you pulled the throttle back to the proper setting for climb and adjusted the mixture to a more a lean position. I guess I was in shock because of so much power on take off I forget to adjust the power and R.P.M. control, and finally the wave in the tower said “O.K. you can pull the throttle back anytime in a sarcastic voice and that woke me up and I continued on fine. When I got to my cruising altitude, I could not believe the power the plane had and the big long nose was something else. It was some change from the 650 H.P. SNJ to this 2000 H.P. Pratt and Whitney engine. Now came the time for my landing.

The runway I had to land on had a telephone line at the front of the landing strip. I make a nice approach and was about to touch my wheels down when the wave in the tower told me to go around, so I added throttle and went around. The radio was not working well and I could hardly hear. The second approach I was about to touch my wheels down when I heard the same thing from the tower. I went around again and finally the wave told me my canopy was not open. I don’t know why she made me go around as I was just about down both times, but everything worked out o.k. That was a solo to remember.

The type of plane I soled was an F3A-1 Corsair built by Brewster Corp. There were a total of 12,000 corsairs built and only 700 by Brewster. The reason for that was the Navy thought Brewster Corp. was doing an inferior job. Of the 700 that Brewster built, 300 went to the British, so it was quite rare to fly one of these. They were the bird cage canopy type. The serial no. of the plane I soled was 04618 which were only 300 off the assembly line. I could not believe I was flying a powerful airplane like the Corsair.

The call name for the air station was Blue base and the call name for our group of 8 was Bingo 264. The number may be wrong, but like that. There were so many airplanes there that there was a landing or take off every 2 minutes for the entire war, from 1942 to 1945. We always flew in a flight of 8 like all the other groups. When you were approaching the field you would call the tower asking for landing instructions, and mostly they would tell us to orbit at 3,000 feet. There would be groups of 8 in a complete circle, like flying formation with each group. Finally they would clear us to the 2,000 foot level, and then to the 1,000 foot level and finally clear us to land. Why there were not more collisions I don’t know.

The planes we flew were parked in the same spot all the time and we would meet every day at the time we were supposed to go up. From my barracks to the planes was only a few hundreds yards. The first time out group went up was on the 30th of August, 1944. We would taxi behind each other and zig zag back and forth so we could see so we would not run into each other, which was a good idea. At the end of the runway we would stop, rev out motor as fast as it would go with out going up on its nose and check the magnetos both left and right. The R.P.M. was supposed to drop less than 100 for each magneto. If this was O.K. we each took off and joined up as fast as we could in formation. I forgot who I flew on, and it was not the same person each day. My total hours in flight at that time were about 273 hours. Not much to be flying a high powered plane like the Corsair, Less than J.F.K.

During the first flight I stayed back from the guy I was flying on to far and got my ass reamed out about that. As I said before, we did not have enough meetings to find out some of these facts. We learned the hard way. For the first 7 flights we would do familiarization and practice flying formation, learning to join up in formation, coming in to the field and breaking off one at a time to land. For the next 14 months until the end of the war we would be flying in an 8 plane formation and it was not long before we got pretty good at it.

Every time we went up, it seemed like there was a mayday, meaning someone was going down, mostly from engine trouble. The rules were we were supposed to keep off the radio so the accidents could be report to the air station. That would never happen as usually someone would yell, shut up your god damn mouth. The waves who ran the tower would also get into it. As the years went by, someone would find one of the planes in the swamp or somewhere. I can tell you where there are a couple of planes today, in the water. When the planes got to old, they would take them on a barge out to sea and dump them. the navy would love to find them today. I am sure some of them would be the rare F3A-1 Brewster planes.

From time to time we would go up in an SNJ trainer to get more instruction in instrument flying. This would happen to keep up in good shape in case of an emergency, and later on this training that would save my life. They would put us under a hood so we could not see and give us the works. After while it got fairly easy. By watching the altitude, the air speed, and the direction you were going kept you from getting into trouble. If you were careless and lost your orientation, it would be difficult to recover and that is what happened to J.F.K. Once you were in trouble, they teach us to recover. One of the things they would do is, the instructor would fly the plane all over the sky, loops, dives, and steep banks, and all this under the hood with only the instrument panel to look at, and sometime during this he would ask you to recover. You could be on you back, or in any position. I know I would never be an instructor doing this and trust someone to recover, no, no. In fact I would not be an instructor. When the instructor was flying the plane all over the sky, you would be watching the instrument panel to see if the plane was going down or up. If it were going down the airspeed would be fast, then as it was going up the airspeed would start to decrease. The large hand on the altitude gage would be going around so fast; you had to decide real quickly whether you were going up or down. As you were going down your wings may not be level, or in a steep diving turn. If you were in a steep diving turn and he asked you to recover, you would have to level your wings first, before you pulled out, other wise you would go into a suicide dive, like J.F.K. did. Because of this training we became better trained then the Army pilot who I know did not get this training. Many pilots lost there lives because they did not know these things, especially civilian life.

I had 8 instruments flights while at NAS Jacksonville, so you see how important this was, besides the instrument course at NAS Pensacola. Ensign Joe Emmett became lost while flying alone and had to land at an auxiliary field overnight and while coming back, he slightly hit a tree and ripped the flaps off his plane while landing. While flying formation, Joe LaDuke would be looking inside the cockpit to much and we would pull away and he would wonder where we went. When he looked up nobody would be there. He took that fooling around pretty good. Another time, while on a gunnery run he passed out, but recovered before he hit the water. He had no idea why that happened. Maybe he blacked out but most of the time it would only be the lost of your vision and to much “G” force.

Of the 8 pilots, Lt Robert Brewer, Ensign Joe Laduke and I stayed together until the end of the war.

The next 6 flights were tactical flights and could be anything from simulated carrier landings, practicing combat or just flying around. One of the flights was a high altitude flight to about 40,000 feet to test our oxygen equipment. When you at that height, you would be going a lot faster than the indicated speed on the instrument panel. If your indicated speed on your gage was 200, you would really be going about 400 miles per hour ground speed. You could really tell by the some of wind going by the plane and you could not turn to sharp, or you would stall out because of the rare atmosphere, or thin air.

We had to practice what they called field carrier landings which would be at an auxiliary field where a landing field officer would be to bring us in. We would fly over the field and break off to get an interval and take our turn’s one at a time. We would do this for at least 8 landings. As soon as we hit the runway we would add throttle and go around for the next landing. The landing signal officer would tell you whether you were going to fast or to slow. Also he would give you the signal to high or to low. You had to trust and obey his signals or you would be in trouble. They were the boss and they had the authority to tell anyone off including Admirals, and they did. On a carrier, if you were not doing to good, they could ground you. On one of my approaches the signal officer gave me a slow signal to late and I stalled out and was headed right for him. He dropped his signal flags and took off running. I hit on my left wheel, bounced in the air. Added throttle and kept on going. We would meet with him back at the base and he would chew out who ever needed it and discuss the landings with us. He never mentioned that I made him drop his paddles. He knew it was his fault.

The reason we would practice carrier landings was for our next Assignment at NAS Glenview just north of Chicago and we had to make 8 landings on one of the two carriers operating there to qualify.

Combat or dog fighting was part of the tactical stage and we took turns with each of us to try and see who the best was. One of my combats was with Lt. Richard Schaefer, our leader. The rules were that we were not allowed to touch the throttle. We set it at 22 inches of mercury and left it there. The start was the same as at Pensacola. One had the advantage of 1,000 feet and going head on and when we were over and under each other that was the signal to go. We finally got down to the same altitude going head on and then in a circle opposite each other. We tried all the tricks, like putting your landing gear down. Going around the circle I would stall out and recover, stall out again and recover. The slower you went the more sharply you could turn. We finished with a draw and when we got back to the base. He accused me of adding throttle, and maybe he did. How could you tell from another plane?

I had another combat with Ensign Pete Kantralis and we went round and round and finally he got on my tail, so I did a split “S” and after recovering I noticed the fabric was coming off my wing. These planes were so old and bad shape that anything could happen. The wings were fabric covered aft of the leading spar. I radioed him and told him I was going back to the base. The unwritten rule was to never leave some one alone. He should have followed me back. He said he was going to fool around, so I went back to the base. Later on about 7 O’clock at night. Schaefer, our commander asks me if I knew where Pete was. I told him I didn’t know and the last time I saw him was over the coast line after we had our combat. What h A farmer said he saw a plane going straight down about 3 miles off shore. Pete said he was going to make a career of the navy and I guess he did. He was 22 years old. Every new base we went to, we had to fill out a form and name who you wanted to escort your body where it was to be buried. Pete had named Ensign Joe LeDuke and the place of internment was Arlington cemetery. It was about one month before the navy said they found his body, and Joe escorted him to Washington for burial. I have never believed they found his body. How could you find an airplane 3 miles off shore and how would you get to it I think the sent an empty coffin to Arlington cemetery.

I use to go into downtown Jacksonville on a bus once in a while and also to Jacksonville Beach which was about 10 miles. There was a restaurant called Barney’s restaurant, bar and cocktail lounge and they advertised to come and dine with the man in green. They had a picture of a man in green and a dog in their advertising and pictured in the restaurant. Right across the street was a very nice theater with a large marquee, which I went to once in a while. Jacksonville was a very nice looking downtown. I wonder what it looks like now.

I only went up night flying 4 times and that was enough for me. There were very tall tapered lights along the runway, and this was very old fashion and was to disappear from all the bases and civilian fields also I would say the lights were at least 3 or 4 foot high. On my take off, was a little careless. There was a cross wing and I drifted to the right and as I was becoming airborne, I felt a jar on my right landing gear. At that time I didn’t know what it was. The navy would station someone at the end of the runway and check to see if your landing gear came up o.k. Just after take off before I left the field, they called me and said one of my landing gear was not retracted. I put the landing gear down and then up and everything worked well. Then I realized that I may have hit one of the lights. Also I though I might have a flat tire and was going to see if they could check as I was landing, but that was stupid. How could they tell from the ground? As it turned out, I forgot all about it and just after I touched down in my landing, I knew I had a flat tire. Just after touch down the plane swerved shortly to one side, I was afraid it was going to tip over. The plane started to go off the runway and was starting to do a 180 turn. As this was happening I kept pumping the opposite break from the direction I was going. The last 100 yards I was going backwards and finally stopped. If I had hit the light lower on take off me could have demolished the plane and me. I lucked out a number of times. What is interesting is you could do anything like that and the Navy would not do anything about it, in fact, no one ever said any thing to me about it.

I was flying at night and not paying any attention about conserving gas. I must have been up about 2 hours when the engine conked out and I was right over the heart of Jacksonville, downtown about 1,000 feet high. I put the nose down to pick up speed and I knew I was to low to bail out and besides it was a bad area to have a plane crash. The gas tank held 240 gallons of gas, but when you got down to 5o gallons a red light would go on under the gas gage. When this happened you would have to change the indicator to be able to get to the last 50 gallons which was not much for a 2,000 horse power engine. That’s when my brain kicked into over drive. I had the canopy opened and was thinking about jumping out when I thought of the 5o gallon reserve and reached down and changed the lever for the gas tank. Wow, the engine caught and my heart started beating normal. It wasn’t long before I was in the traffic pattern and landed. That was the 2nd night flight of the 4.

The 3rd time I was up doing the same thing, when a RAF pilot joined up on my wing. There was a lot of RAF pilot training to fly the corsair. I tried to make him leave, but he stayed with me like he was afraid to be alone. There were a few clouds about, so I went into one of the clouds and did a quick turn and lost him. The RAF pilots were not to smart and would get the business form all of us.

I was flying down the coast for what reason, I can’t remember when fumes started to come into my cockpit and it was difficult to breath. I open the canopy but the fumes still kept coming in. I was worried about the plane catching fire and I happened to be right above the field at the NAS Mayport which was right on the coast. I did a spit “S” and dove straight down; called the tower at Mayport and they gave me landing instruction. I wasn’t only a few minutes from the start of the fumes to when I landed. I taxied to the flight line and went to the offices at the flight line and told them my trouble. The said I would have to stay over night while they looked at the plane. Seems like there was always something happening to me. In the morning they told me it was a hydraulic leak and it was a good thing I got down as quick as I did for soon I would not have gotten my landing gear down unless I used the system that would allow me to put the gear down only once. I flew back to the base at Jacksonville which was only about 15 minutes away. Every time we went on a gunnery hop, we would meet above the field at NAS Ma port and it is a major station today.

Two other things happened that was not too good and very sad. If you were afraid of flying, you could go the superintendent and ask to get out of flying. Most of the time they would go along with it. You would have to see the psychiatrist. One of the guys wanted to do this, but they talked him into sticking to it a while longer. That was a big mistake. When you feel like that they should let you go right away. This guy was coming in for a landing and lost it, crashed and burned up. The only thing they found was his dog tags. A flyer by the name of Bell was a dare devil. He would take any one on playing chicken. That was when you and the other guy would fly towards each other and the first one to pull away was chicken. He liked to smoke in the cockpit and everyone tried to tell him that was not a good idea. If you had fumes in the cockpit, the plane could explode. This happened to him. His plane blew into many pieces and him to.

Ensign Joe LeDuke had a difficult time keeping roommates. I think he lost 3 roommates before thee war ended. His roommate at NAS Jacksonville was taking off and asked the tower if he could make a right hand turn when leaving the traffic pattern instead of the usual left hand turn. The said yes, but that was a bad decision. He hit an incoming C-47 with 21 nurses aboard and that plane and him crashed into the St. Johns River, killing all of them. I can remember that like it was yesterday. Joe’s roommate was also my friend.

There were many Maydays and lost flyers but you never heard what happened after the crashes, just like nothing happened.

A little more on the corsair, When you were doing the gunnery hops and before you started shooting, you would charge your guns, like putting a shell in the chamber of a rifle. When you were through on the gunnery flight and coming back to the base, you uncharged your guns. You would not want to land with bullets in the chambers of the guns. One day a flyer forgot to uncharged his guns and when one of the mechanics got into the plane he grabbed the stick where the button was to fire the guns and fired a number of shots which went up into the air. When this happened, everybody started ducking. This type of accident happened more than you think.

The corsair had a beautiful gun sight. It was illuminating and when you were firing, the image of the ring sight would project and be on the target. It was a beautiful sight. You did not have to line up two individual sights. The main thing is you had to keep the ball in the ball and bank indicator centered like in a level for construction. The angle of the plane must be in the direction of your firing. You could not be in a slip or skid.

At this base we did mostly gunnery practice. We did not fire rockets and very little dive bombing, but that would come later. Each gun carried 400 rounds of bullets. When we fired the guns, we only fired 2 guns at one time. If you couldn’t hit with 2 guns you were in trouble. We could fire the inboard guns in each wing, or the center, or the outboard guns, or all at once. The ordinance would bore sight the guns from time to time. One of the troubles in firing is when the guns would jam. This happened when some of the bullets were shorter or longer. When the guns were loaded, the ammunition had to be the same size. There were many times when my guns would jam. You would charge and recharge them, but to no avail. You couldn’t go back so you went through your runs with out firing.

One day while standing around the field, we were told that a flyer was trying to land, but could not slow the engine down. He would pull the throttle back and nothing would happen. He made a number of passes at the field but could not make it work. Finally they told to him to fly low over the run way and a short distance from the end of the run way and shut the engine off. This gave him only one chance to get down safe. That’s what he did and it worked out good.

One thing you should do in every plane is to go to a high altitude, pull the throttle back and see what attitude you need to glide safely. No one did this. You did not have time, but in civilian flying you should do that. If the engine cut out in this high wing loading plane, you were not able to make turns as the plane would stall out. They told us if the engine cut out on take off, you should fly straight ahead and take what ever comes. It would be impossible to turn back to the field, and as you could in smaller planes like the piper cub or the Stearman.

## CHAPTER TWELVE: NAS Glenview, Illinois and the First Carrier Landings on the U.S. Wolverine

We finally finished our course and they gave us our order to the NAS station at Glenview, Illinois. We traveled alone and it was up to me to arrange my travel arrangements. I would be reimbursed on payday for the travel expense. The date was the 25th of Oct. 1944. I arrived in Chicago about the first week in November, 1944. It seemed strange that we all got our orders and would eventually meet at the Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois. Of the 8 in our group that started, 6 of us got orders to Glenview for our first landings on a carrier. Ensign LeDuke, Ensign Liles, Ensign McGaffin, Lt Brewer, Lt Dahlstrom, and our leader Lt Schaefer. The train ride from Jacksonville to Chicago took 2 days and the ride was very enjoyable, just setting and watching the scenery, or reading. We always had a sleeper and it seemed easy to go to sleep with the sound of the wheels of the train making a clipping noise. The food on the diner was always good. All of the conductors and the ones working on the train were colored and they seemed to take a lot of pride in their work and did a wonderful job. The reason it took 2 days to get to Chicago, was the train would stop a large no of times to pick up passengers.

Pulling into Dearborn station was really exciting. The train would travel very slowly and you would be passing by the parts of the city of Chicago. When the train stopped at the station, you could hear the bells from the train ringing and the hissing of the smoke, and all the other sounds at the station. I would go through this station quite a few times before the end of the war. The bellhops of the train would be caring the luggage of the people; it was some sight to see all of this. This is pass history now and the hassle and bustle of the train station is long gone and has great memories. In the station there is everything that you could want Stores, Barbers, Shoe shine people, rest rooms, a lot like the airports today. I had to find out the directions to the Naval Air Station and that was Easy by asking the ticket station. I was told the station was near Evanston, Illinois and I could catch an Elevated train there a few blocks from the station. I believe Evanston is where the University of Northwestern is. There are a number of good colleges around Chicago. One of them is The University of Chicago, which is a very old school and probable very difficult to enroll in today.

The travel time to Evanston was only about 30 minutes, and short bus ride to the station. When I arrived at the gate, I had to pass out another one of my orders and given directions to the administration. There they assigned me to my room in one of the many wooden barracks, which were all over the place. The Navy always shipped my luggage to each new place. I wonder how they did that with all of the people traveling to different places.

I forgot to mention that the reason there were only 6 of us to go to Glenview was Ensign Pete Kantralis was killed and Lt. Gordon went to night fighters. The last flight at NAS Jacksonville was on the 25th of October 1944 and my orders were to report to the Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois. The orders were dated Nov. 2nd Oct.1944. You can see that I did no flying from the 25th to the date I reported to Glenview which was Nov. 5th 1944.

There were two carriers at Glenview, the USS Wolverine, converted from the great lakes 4 stacker The Sea and Bee, which during the great lakes travel, they were capable of carrying 6000 passengers and was a side wheeler just like the Mississippi river boats. At the time I did not know this. Both carriers were coal burners. Both ships were striped down to the water line and a flight deck was added. The Second ship was the USS Sable that was converted from the Greater Buffalo, and was also a side wheeler. Both great lakes ships were built around 1912. I landed on the USS Wolverine and my two friends I enlisted with, Gerald Nichols, and Robert Thompson landed on the USS Sable flying F6F Hellcats.

Most aviators arrived at Glenview with about 320 to 350 hours of flying time. My flying time was 360 hours. All of the flyers arriving at Glenview came form one of the operational training schools along the east coast of Florida. Each arriving carrier pilot at CQTU immediately enters into the rigorous training, and before he is sent out to the Wolverine or Sable he must satisfy his CQTU instructors that he can simulate satisfactory deck landings. This is done at one of Glenview’s many outlying satellite airfields, where a rectangle the size of a carrier deck has been marked out, and flying the type of fighter, scout bomber or torpedo bomber he will pilot in the fleet. He must make a series of satisfactory approaches and landings and show that he can follow the signals of the landing signal officer correctly.

Although nearly all CQTU operations consist of training, the unit’s safety record was amazing. In the more than 40,000 landings and take, offs on both carriers there had been only 11 fatalities and only two of those took place on a carrier itself. Of the 10 others, five were due to invertent spins, and two were caused by midair collision and two were lost in a snow storm. There were many other accidents and I heard there were at least 30 planes at the bottom of Lake Michigan.

We arrived at NAS Glenview on the 5th of Nov. and after getting settled, we were given instructions on what was going to happen. All 6 of us finally got together. We went to a few classes for instruction and we found out our first flight was to be on the 9th of Nov. so we had a few days to find something to do. I went into Chicago on the elevated train and that took about 30 minutes. Chicago in 1944 was a beautiful place and untouched from its mostly original state. Most of the shopping area was on State Street, not like Michigan avenue today. The stores were beautiful and a lot of nice places to eat. One of the theaters was called the Chicago and was beautiful with about 4 floors and lounges. As the years went by the theater became a rat’s nest and was in bad decay. I was in Chicago on business in late 1980 and went to the Chicago theater and the usher told me to look out for the rats There was a guy who worked on the streets that did silhouettes and I had him make a couple for me. I have those stored away today. The entire downtown was clean and so nice to wonder around in. There were no McDonalds or X-rated movies houses. Chicago was just plain nice.

You could ride the elevated trains and not have to worry about getting shot or beaten up, or robbed. On one of my trips back to the Naval Air Station, I was a little tired and was starting to fall asleep and a young women next to me told my to put my head on her shoulder and go to sleep. I don’t think that would happen today.

Back at the base we were noticed that our first flight was to be on the 9th and it would be a flight to look around and to see the carrier form an altitude that we would not interfere in the carrier operation. I know that people would stand on the shore and watch the carrier operations. The plane that I flew on the flight was an FG-1 very early Goodyear plane serial no.13279. And the flight lasted 1.1 hours. The next day we went to one of the out lying fields to make some simulated carrier landings and prove to the LSO that we could do that. The plane I flew on this flight was an F3A-1 Brewster build plane and one of the rare 700 planes that were building by Brewster. I think this was quite rare to fly this type of plane in operational at Jacksonville and for carrier landings at Glenview. Everything worked out good and we were all qualified to go out to the USS Wolverine for our 8 landings.

We flew back to Glenview and that afternoon we were scheduled to fly to the Carrier. Again I was assigned to fly a Brewster plane serial number 04664, the same plane I flew for simulated landings at the out lying field. Before we were assigned our planes, we would wait by the flight board for our flight to be posted. Finally it came our turn. They did not trust us to go out to the carrier on our one so we would gather around our instructor who would give us last minute pointers and assign each pilot to a position in the formation. Small maps of the area were given to each pilot so he could plot the direction to the carrier. All navigation to and from the carries centers on point oboe, the code name assigned to the famed Baha’i Temple, a prominent landmark in Wilmette, Ill. on the shore of lake Michigan. Flight to and from the carrier passed over point oboe. An instructor in an SNJ trainer leads the flight to and from the carrier. I wonder what you would do in combat out in the huge ocean.

We went to the flight line, started our engines and started taxing in the order that the instructor gave us. The leader was Lt. Schaefer at Jacksonville. The reason for a known order was the LSO had to know so he could mark us. When it came time for me to take off, I should have known I was going to have trouble. The minute I got off the ground, the plane started to swing to the left in a sharp turn. I gave it full right rudder and full right stick. I noticed right away that only one of my flaps was down. We usually took of with 30 degrees flaps and I didn’t notice that only one was down. That never happened to me before or after. I kept the nose down to pick up some speed as I was afraid the plane was going to stall out. Still in a steep turn, but going a little faster I raised the flat up at 10 degrees at a time until the flat was up and was o.k. When I got up to a good altitude I tested the flaps and they worked good and at the same time and worked good from then on. We joined up in formation and with the help of the leading plane and instructor, put us on the correct course and soon we saw the carrier, The temperature was very cold and the ceiling was only 200 feet, but we did not have to go very high.

We passed on the right side of the carrier in right formation at 800 feet. As soon as we got a fair distance in front of the carrier the leader signaled he was going to break off and we all did that so we had a good interval and dropping down to about 200 feet putting the wheels and full flaps down and slowing down to about 95 knots.. Looking to the left and as soon as you got even with the rear of the carrier you started your turn. Shortly you looked at the LSO and followed his signals and you better or you would hear about it later. The first signal of the LSO was a roger, meaning you were in good position. The first signal the LSO would give you was being too high or to low and other signals after that. My first landing was a roger all the way and he gave me a cut, meaning to take the power off and land. I thought, boy this is really easy. Wrong. After that I got a few wave offs, meaning to go a round again. One of my landings was very bad. As soon as I got the cut, I pulled the throttle back and my plane turned in a right bank and I hit the deck on one wheel, bounced high, but the hook caught and I went skidding to the right and stopped with my right wheel only one foot from going off the deck. They pulled me back into position and I took off o.k. I finally found out why this happened, but learned the hard way. Part of it was the fault of the LSO. If you are in a Skid when you stall out, one of the wings will drop really quickly. This happened to me at Jacksonville while training. The LSO was supposed to see that and wave you off. You have to keep the ball and bank centered, but difficult to do when you are only looking at the LSO; I was not the last one to get my 8 landings. The leader, Lt. Schaefer was the last one. My total time for that flight was 1.5 hours. Not to bad. The only way you could flunk was to get killed. Making the 8 landings was good enough. Your marks maybe wouldn’t be the best, but you passed. Lt. Com. Peters the LSO marked me satisfactory. His comments were I dropped my left wing and was slow on answering signals. When we got back to field there was a pretty happy bunch of guys, even better than when you soloed.


Okay, continuing on to complete this Markdown conversion.

. I wish there had been a picture of us as a group but that did not happen. Most of the groups did have there picture taken. The first thing we did was to have training classes to learn all about the F4U Corsair and to learn about the base and the traffic pattern and the area. They set up a mock cockpit of the corsair and we had to learn the instrument panel and we would have a test blind folded, so we knew it very well.

The Corsair did not have an electrical start. We had to use a Kaufman Cartridge which was put in a firing position at the right side of the engine, like a shotgun rifle. When you pressed the starter, the cartridge would fire and turn the prop a few times and you would hope to start the engine that way. Most of the time it took more than one cartridge to start the engine. The planes we were to fly were mostly back from combat and were in the worst of shape. All of them were of the canopy bird cage type. It wasn’t till later that they came out with ignition start and a bubble canopy. We had the same planes all through our training at Jacksonville.

One of the mechanics was a sailor named Al Vandemullen who was on the tennis team at Flint Central High School with me. He had been washed out as a cadet so ended up NAS Jacksonville as a mechanic. He told me he wouldn’t fly those planes for anything because they were in such bad shape. He was transferred to the Carrier, the USS Intrepid and was standing on the deck when a Japanese Kamikaze hit where he was standing and he was killed. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Al had a car in high school and we use to drive it all over the place. In those days a lot of kids had a car.

I was 20 years old at this time. Percy Liles was 22 and Pete Kantralis and Joe Laduke were also 22 years old, leaving me as the youngest.

On my solo flight I was given instruction to taxi the plane around the field for a few minutes and then take off. This was all done with the women waves in the tower giving us instructions, as they had seen this done many times. I had the sequence all figured out. Everything was set in the plane. I had the engine fixed at full mixture, full R.P.M. etc. As soon as you left the ground, you pulled the throttle back to the proper setting for climb and adjusted the mixture to a more a lean position. I guess I was in shock because of so much power on take off I forget to adjust the power and R.P.M. control, and finally the wave in the tower said “O.K. you can pull the throttle back anytime in a sarcastic voice and that woke me up and I continued on fine. When I got to my cruising altitude, I could not believe the power the plane had and the big long nose was something else. It was some change from the 650 H.P. SNJ to this 2000 H.P. Pratt and Whitney engine. Now came the time for my landing.

The runway I had to land on had a telephone line at the front of the landing strip. I make a nice approach and was about to touch my wheels down when the wave in the tower told me to go around, so I added throttle and went around. The radio was not working well and I could hardly hear. The second approach I was about to touch my wheels down when I heard the same thing from the tower. I went around again and finally the wave told me my canopy was not open. I don’t know why she made me go around as I was just about down both times, but everything worked out o.k. That was a solo to remember.

The type of plane I soled was an F3A-1 Corsair built by Brewster Corp. There were a total of 12,000 corsairs built and only 700 by Brewster. The reason for that was the Navy thought Brewster Corp. was doing an inferior job. Of the 700 that Brewster built, 300 went to the British, so it was quite rare to fly one of these. They were the bird cage canopy type. The serial no. of the plane I soled was 04618 which were only 300 off the assembly line. I could not believe I was flying a powerful airplane like the Corsair.

The call name for the air station was Blue base and the call name for our group of 8 was Bingo 264. The number may be wrong, but like that. There were so many airplanes there that there was a landing or take off every 2 minutes for the entire war, from 1942 to 1945. We always flew in a flight of 8 like all the other groups. When you were approaching the field you would call the tower asking for landing instructions, and mostly they would tell us to orbit at 3,000 feet. There would be groups of 8 in a complete circle, like flying formation with each group. Finally they would clear us to the 2,000 foot level, and then to the 1,000 foot level and finally clear us to land. Why there were not more collisions I don’t know.

The planes we flew were parked in the same spot all the time and we would meet every day at the time we were supposed to go up. From my barracks to the planes was only a few hundreds yards. The first time out group went up was on the 30th of August, 1944. We would taxi behind each other and zig zag back and forth so we could see so we would not run into each other, which was a good idea. At the end of the runway we would stop, rev out motor as fast as it would go with out going up on its nose and check the magnetos both left and right. The R.P.M. was supposed to drop less than 100 for each magneto. If this was O.K. we each took off and joined up as fast as we could in formation. I forgot who I flew on, and it was not the same person each day. My total hours in flight at that time were about 273 hours. Not much to be flying a high powered plane like the Corsair, Less than J.F.K.

During the first flight I stayed back from the guy I was flying on to far and got my ass reamed out about that. As I said before, we did not have enough meetings to find out some of these facts. We learned the hard way. For the first 7 flights we would do familiarization and practice flying formation, learning to join up in formation, coming in to the field and breaking off one at a time to land. For the next 14 months until the end of the war we would be flying in an 8 plane formation and it was not long before we got pretty good at it.

Every time we went up, it seemed like there was a mayday, meaning someone was going down, mostly from engine trouble. The rules were we were supposed to keep off the radio so the accidents could be report to the air station. That would never happen as usually someone would yell, shut up your god damn mouth. The waves who ran the tower would also get into it. As the years went by, someone would find one of the planes in the swamp or somewhere. I can tell you where there are a couple of planes today, in the water. When the planes got to old, they would take them on a barge out to sea and dump them. the navy would love to find them today. I am sure some of them would be the rare F3A-1 Brewster planes.

From time to time we would go up in an SNJ trainer to get more instruction in instrument flying. This would happen to keep up in good shape in case of an emergency, and later on this training that would save my life. They would put us under a hood so we could not see and give us the works. After while it got fairly easy. By watching the altitude, the air speed, and the direction you were going kept you from getting into trouble. If you were careless and lost your orientation, it would be difficult to recover and that is what happened to J.F.K. Once you were in trouble, they teach us to recover. One of the things they would do is, the instructor would fly the plane all over the sky, loops, dives, and steep banks, and all this under the hood with only the instrument panel to look at, and sometime during this he would ask you to recover. You could be on you back, or in any position. I know I would never be an instructor doing this and trust someone to recover, no, no. In fact I would not be an instructor. When the instructor was flying the plane all over the sky, you would be watching the instrument panel to see if the plane was going down or up. If it were going down the airspeed would be fast, then as it was going up the airspeed would start to decrease. The large hand on the altitude gage would be going around so fast; you had to decide real quickly whether you were going up or down. As you were going down your wings may not be level, or in a steep diving turn. If you were in a steep diving turn and he asked you to recover, you would have to level your wings first, before you pulled out, other wise you would go into a suicide dive, like J.F.K. did. Because of this training we became better trained then the Army pilot who I know did not get this training. Many pilots lost there lives because they did not know these things, especially civilian life.

I had 8 instruments flights while at NAS Jacksonville, so you see how important this was, besides the instrument course at NAS Pensacola. Ensign Joe Emmett became lost while flying alone and had to land at an auxiliary field overnight and while coming back, he slightly hit a tree and ripped the flaps off his plane while landing. While flying formation, Joe LaDuke would be looking inside the cockpit to much and we would pull away and he would wonder where we went. When he looked up nobody would be there. He took that fooling around pretty good. Another time, while on a gunnery run he passed out, but recovered before he hit the water. He had no idea why that happened. Maybe he blacked out but most of the time it would only be the lost of your vision and to much “G” force.

Of the 8 pilots, Lt Robert Brewer, Ensign Joe Laduke and I stayed together until the end of the war.

The next 6 flights were tactical flights and could be anything from simulated carrier landings, practicing combat or just flying around. One of the flights was a high altitude flight to about 40,000 feet to test our oxygen equipment. When you at that height, you would be going a lot faster than the indicated speed on the instrument panel. If your indicated speed on your gage was 200, you would really be going about 400 miles per hour ground speed. You could really tell by the some of wind going by the plane and you could not turn to sharp, or you would stall out because of the rare atmosphere, or thin air.

We had to practice what they called field carrier landings which would be at an auxiliary field where a landing field officer would be to bring us in. We would fly over the field and break off to get an interval and take our turn’s one at a time. We would do this for at least 8 landings. As soon as we hit the runway we would add throttle and go around for the next landing. The landing signal officer would tell you whether you were going to fast or to slow. Also he would give you the signal to high or to low. You had to trust and obey his signals or you would be in trouble. They were the boss and they had the authority to tell anyone off including Admirals, and they did. On a carrier, if you were not doing to good, they could ground you. On one of my approaches the signal officer gave me a slow signal to late and I stalled out and was headed right for him. He dropped his signal flags and took off running. I hit on my left wheel, bounced in the air. Added throttle and kept on going. We would meet with him back at the base and he would chew out who ever needed it and discuss the landings with us. He never mentioned that I made him drop his paddles. He knew it was his fault.

The reason we would practice carrier landings was for our next Assignment at NAS Glenview just north of Chicago and we had to make 8 landings on one of the two carriers operating there to qualify.

Combat or dog fighting was part of the tactical stage and we took turns with each of us to try and see who the best was. One of my combats was with Lt. Richard Schaefer, our leader. The rules were that we were not allowed to touch the throttle. We set it at 22 inches of mercury and left it there. The start was the same as at Pensacola. One had the advantage of 1,000 feet and going head on and when we were over and under each other that was the signal to go. We finally got down to the same altitude going head on and then in a circle opposite each other. We tried all the tricks, like putting your landing gear down. Going around the circle I would stall out and recover, stall out again and recover. The slower you went the more sharply you could turn. We finished with a draw and when we got back to the base. He accused me of adding throttle, and maybe he did. How could you tell from another plane?

I had another combat with Ensign Pete Kantralis and we went round and round and finally he got on my tail, so I did a split “S” and after recovering I noticed the fabric was coming off my wing. These planes were so old and bad shape that anything could happen. The wings were fabric covered aft of the leading spar. I radioed him and told him I was going back to the base. The unwritten rule was to never leave some one alone. He should have followed me back. He said he was going to fool around, so I went back to the base. Later on about 7 O’clock at night. Schaefer, our commander asks me if I knew where Pete was. I told him I didn’t know and the last time I saw him was over the coast line after we had our combat. What h A farmer said he saw a plane going straight down about 3 miles off shore. Pete said he was going to make a career of the navy and I guess he did. He was 22 years old. Every new base we went to, we had to fill out a form and name who you wanted to escort your body where it was to be buried. Pete had named Ensign Joe LeDuke and the place of internment was Arlington cemetery. It was about one month before the navy said they found his body, and Joe escorted him to Washington for burial. I have never believed they found his body. How could you find an airplane 3 miles off shore and how would you get to it I think the sent an empty coffin to Arlington cemetery.

I use to go into downtown Jacksonville on a bus once in a while and also to Jacksonville Beach which was about 10 miles. There was a restaurant called Barney’s restaurant, bar and cocktail lounge and they advertised to come and dine with the man in green. They had a picture of a man in green and a dog in their advertising and pictured in the restaurant. Right across the street was a very nice theater with a large marquee, which I went to once in a while. Jacksonville was a very nice looking downtown. I wonder what it looks like now.

I only went up night flying 4 times and that was enough for me. There were very tall tapered lights along the runway, and this was very old fashion and was to disappear from all the bases and civilian fields also I would say the lights were at least 3 or 4 foot high. On my take off, was a little careless. There was a cross wing and I drifted to the right and as I was becoming airborne, I felt a jar on my right landing gear. At that time I didn’t know what it was. The navy would station someone at the end of the runway and check to see if your landing gear came up o.k. Just after take off before I left the field, they called me and said one of my landing gear was not retracted. I put the landing gear down and then up and everything worked well. Then I realized that I may have hit one of the lights. Also I though I might have a flat tire and was going to see if they could check as I was landing, but that was stupid. How could they tell from the ground? As it turned out, I forgot all about it and just after I touched down in my landing, I knew I had a flat tire. Just after touch down the plane swerved shortly to one side, I was afraid it was going to tip over. The plane started to go off the runway and was starting to do a 180 turn. As this was happening I kept pumping the opposite break from the direction I was going. The last 100 yards I was going backwards and finally stopped. If I had hit the light lower on take off me could have demolished the plane and me. I lucked out a number of times. What is interesting is you could do anything like that and the Navy would not do anything about it, in fact, no one ever said any thing to me about it.

I was flying at night and not paying any attention about conserving gas. I must have been up about 2 hours when the engine conked out and I was right over the heart of Jacksonville, downtown about 1,000 feet high. I put the nose down to pick up speed and I knew I was to low to bail out and besides it was a bad area to have a plane crash. The gas tank held 240 gallons of gas, but when you got down to 5o gallons a red light would go on under the gas gage. When this happened you would have to change the indicator to be able to get to the last 50 gallons which was not much for a 2,000 horse power engine. That’s when my brain kicked into over drive. I had the canopy opened and was thinking about jumping out when I thought of the 5o gallon reserve and reached down and changed the lever for the gas tank. Wow, the engine caught and my heart started beating normal. It wasn’t long before I was in the traffic pattern and landed. That was the 2nd night flight of the 4.

The 3rd time I was up doing the same thing, when a RAF pilot joined up on my wing. There was a lot of RAF pilot training to fly the corsair. I tried to make him leave, but he stayed with me like he was afraid to be alone. There were a few clouds about, so I went into one of the clouds and did a quick turn and lost him. The RAF pilots were not to smart and would get the business form all of us.

I was flying down the coast for what reason, I can’t remember when fumes started to come into my cockpit and it was difficult to breath. I open the canopy but the fumes still kept coming in. I was worried about the plane catching fire and I happened to be right above the field at the NAS Mayport which was right on the coast. I did a spit “S” and dove straight down; called the tower at Mayport and they gave me landing instruction. I wasn’t only a few minutes from the start of the fumes to when I landed. I taxied to the flight line and went to the offices at the flight line and told them my trouble. The said I would have to stay over night while they looked at the plane. Seems like there was always something happening to me. In the morning they told me it was a hydraulic leak and it was a good thing I got down as quick as I did for soon I would not have gotten my landing gear down unless I used the system that would allow me to put the gear down only once. I flew back to the base at Jacksonville which was only about 15 minutes away. Every time we went on a gunnery hop, we would meet above the field at NAS Ma port and it is a major station today.

Two other things happened that was not too good and very sad. If you were afraid of flying, you could go the superintendent and ask to get out of flying. Most of the time they would go along with it. You would have to see the psychiatrist. One of the guys wanted to do this, but they talked him into sticking to it a while longer. That was a big mistake. When you feel like that they should let you go right away. This guy was coming in for a landing and lost it, crashed and burned up. The only thing they found was his dog tags. A flyer by the name of Bell was a dare devil. He would take any one on playing chicken. That was when you and the other guy would fly towards each other and the first one to pull away was chicken. He liked to smoke in the cockpit and everyone tried to tell him that was not a good idea. If you had fumes in the cockpit, the plane could explode. This happened to him. His plane blew into many pieces and him to.

Ensign Joe LeDuke had a difficult time keeping roommates. I think he lost 3 roommates before thee war ended. His roommate at NAS Jacksonville was taking off and asked the tower if he could make a right hand turn when leaving the traffic pattern instead of the usual left hand turn. The said yes, but that was a bad decision. He hit an incoming C-47 with 21 nurses aboard and that plane and him crashed into the St. Johns River, killing all of them. I can remember that like it was yesterday. Joe’s roommate was also my friend.

There were many Maydays and lost flyers but you never heard what happened after the crashes, just like nothing happened.

A little more on the corsair, When you were doing the gunnery hops and before you started shooting, you would charge your guns, like putting a shell in the chamber of a rifle. When you were through on the gunnery flight and coming back to the base, you uncharged your guns. You would not want to land with bullets in the chambers of the guns. One day a flyer forgot to uncharged his guns and when one of the mechanics got into the plane he grabbed the stick where the button was to fire the guns and fired a number of shots which went up into the air. When this happened, everybody started ducking. This type of accident happened more than you think.

The corsair had a beautiful gun sight. It was illuminating and when you were firing, the image of the ring sight would project and be on the target. It was a beautiful sight. You did not have to line up two individual sights. The main thing is you had to keep the ball in the ball and bank indicator centered like in a level for construction. The angle of the plane must be in the direction of your firing. You could not be in a slip or skid.

At this base we did mostly gunnery practice. We did not fire rockets and very little dive bombing, but that would come later. Each gun carried 400 rounds of bullets. When we fired the guns, we only fired 2 guns at one time. If you couldn’t hit with 2 guns you were in trouble. We could fire the inboard guns in each wing, or the center, or the outboard guns, or all at once. The ordinance would bore sight the guns from time to time. One of the troubles in firing is when the guns would jam. This happened when some of the bullets were shorter or longer. When the guns were loaded, the ammunition had to be the same size. There were many times when my guns would jam. You would charge and recharge them, but to no avail. You couldn’t go back so you went through your runs with out firing.

One day while standing around the field, we were told that a flyer was trying to land, but could not slow the engine down. He would pull the throttle back and nothing would happen. He made a number of passes at the field but could not make it work. Finally they told to him to fly low over the run way and a short distance from the end of the run way and shut the engine off. This gave him only one chance to get down safe. That’s what he did and it worked out good.

One thing you should do in every plane is to go to a high altitude, pull the throttle back and see what attitude you need to glide safely. No one did this. You did not have time, but in civilian flying you should do that. If the engine cut out in this high wing loading plane, you were not able to make turns as the plane would stall out. They told us if the engine cut out on take off, you should fly straight ahead and take what ever comes. It would be impossible to turn back to the field, and as you could in smaller planes like the piper cub or the Stearman.

## CHAPTER TWELVE: NAS Glenview, Illinois and the First Carrier Landings on the U.S. Wolverine

We finally finished our course and they gave us our order to the NAS station at Glenview, Illinois. We traveled alone and it was up to me to arrange my travel arrangements. I would be reimbursed on payday for the travel expense. The date was the 25th of Oct. 1944. I arrived in Chicago about the first week in November, 1944. It seemed strange that we all got our orders and would eventually meet at the Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois. Of the 8 in our group that started, 6 of us got orders to Glenview for our first landings on a carrier. Ensign LeDuke, Ensign Liles, Ensign McGaffin, Lt Brewer, Lt Dahlstrom, and our leader Lt Schaefer. The train ride from Jacksonville to Chicago took 2 days and the ride was very enjoyable, just setting and watching the scenery, or reading. We always had a sleeper and it seemed easy to go to sleep with the sound of the wheels of the train making a clipping noise. The food on the diner was always good. All of the conductors and the ones working on the train were colored and they seemed to take a lot of pride in their work and did a wonderful job. The reason it took 2 days to get to Chicago, was the train would stop a large no of times to pick up passengers.

Pulling into Dearborn station was really exciting. The train would travel very slowly and you would be passing by the parts of the city of Chicago. When the train stopped at the station, you could hear the bells from the train ringing and the hissing of the smoke, and all the other sounds at the station. I would go through this station quite a few times before the end of the war. The bellhops of the train would be caring the luggage of the people; it was some sight to see all of this. This is pass history now and the hassle and bustle of the train station is long gone and has great memories. In the station there is everything that you could want Stores, Barbers, Shoe shine people, rest rooms, a lot like the airports today. I had to find out the directions to the Naval Air Station and that was Easy by asking the ticket station. I was told the station was near Evanston, Illinois and I could catch an Elevated train there a few blocks from the station. I believe Evanston is where the University of Northwestern is. There are a number of good colleges around Chicago. One of them is The University of Chicago, which is a very old school and probable very difficult to enroll in today.

The travel time to Evanston was only about 30 minutes, and short bus ride to the station. When I arrived at the gate, I had to pass out another one of my orders and given directions to the administration. There they assigned me to my room in one of the many wooden barracks, which were all over the place. The Navy always shipped my luggage to each new place. I wonder how they did that with all of the people traveling to different places.

I forgot to mention that the reason there were only 6 of us to go to Glenview was Ensign Pete Kantralis was killed and Lt. Gordon went to night fighters. The last flight at NAS Jacksonville was on the 25th of October 1944 and my orders were to report to the Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois. The orders were dated Nov. 2nd Oct.1944. You can see that I did no flying from the 25th to the date I reported to Glenview which was Nov. 5th 1944.

There were two carriers at Glenview, the USS Wolverine, converted from the great lakes 4 stacker The Sea and Bee, which during the great lakes travel, they were capable of carrying 6000 passengers and was a side wheeler just like the Mississippi river boats. At the time I did not know this. Both carriers were coal burners. Both ships were striped down to the water line and a flight deck was added. The Second ship was the USS Sable that was converted from the Greater Buffalo, and was also a side wheeler. Both great lakes ships were built around 1912. I landed on the USS Wolverine and my two friends I enlisted with, Gerald Nichols, and Robert Thompson landed on the USS Sable flying F6F Hellcats.

Most aviators arrived at Glenview with about 320 to 350 hours of flying time. My flying time was 360 hours. All of the flyers arriving at Glenview came form one of the operational training schools along the east coast of Florida. Each arriving carrier pilot at CQTU immediately enters into the rigorous training, and before he is sent out to the Wolverine or Sable he must satisfy his CQTU instructors that he can simulate satisfactory deck landings. This is done at one of Glenview’s many outlying satellite airfields, where a rectangle the size of a carrier deck has been marked out, and flying the type of fighter, scout bomber or torpedo bomber he will pilot in the fleet. He must make a series of satisfactory approaches and landings and show that he can follow the signals of the landing signal officer correctly.

Although nearly all CQTU operations consist of training, the unit’s safety record was amazing. In the more than 40,000 landings and take, offs on both carriers there had been only 11 fatalities and only two of those took place on a carrier itself. Of the 10 others, five were due to invertent spins, and two were caused by midair collision and two were lost in a snow storm. There were many other accidents and I heard there were at least 30 planes at the bottom of Lake Michigan.

We arrived at NAS Glenview on the 5th of Nov. and after getting settled, we were given instructions on what was going to happen. All 6 of us finally got together. We went to a few classes for instruction and we found out our first flight was to be on the 9th of Nov. so we had a few days to find something to do. I went into Chicago on the elevated train and that took about 30 minutes. Chicago in 1944 was a beautiful place and untouched from its mostly original state. Most of the shopping area was on State Street, not like Michigan avenue today. The stores were beautiful and a lot of nice places to eat. One of the theaters was called the Chicago and was beautiful with about 4 floors and lounges. As the years went by the theater became a rat’s nest and was in bad decay. I was in Chicago on business in late 1980 and went to the Chicago theater and the usher told me to look out for the rats There was a guy who worked on the streets that did silhouettes and I had him make a couple for me. I have those stored away today. The entire downtown was clean and so nice to wonder around in. There were no McDonalds or X-rated movies houses. Chicago was just plain nice.

You could ride the elevated trains and not have to worry about getting shot or beaten up, or robbed. On one of my trips back to the Naval Air Station, I was a little tired and was starting to fall asleep and a young women next to me told my to put my head on her shoulder and go to sleep. I don’t think that would happen today.

Back at the base we were noticed that our first flight was to be on the 9th and it would be a flight to look around and to see the carrier form an altitude that we would not interfere in the carrier operation. I know that people would stand on the shore and watch the carrier operations. The plane that I flew on the flight was an FG-1 very early Goodyear plane serial no.13279. And the flight lasted 1.1 hours. The next day we went to one of the out lying fields to make some simulated carrier landings and prove to the LSO that we could do that. The plane I flew on this flight was an F3A-1 Brewster build plane and one of the rare 700 planes that were building by Brewster. I think this was quite rare to fly this type of plane in operational at Jacksonville and for carrier landings at Glenview. Everything worked out good and we were all qualified to go out to the USS Wolverine for our 8 landings.

We flew back to Glenview and that afternoon we were scheduled to fly to the Carrier. Again I was assigned to fly a Brewster plane serial number 04664, the same plane I flew for simulated landings at the out lying field. Before we were assigned our planes, we would wait by the flight board for our flight to be posted. Finally it came our turn. They did not trust us to go out to the carrier on our one so we would gather around our instructor who would give us last minute pointers and assign each pilot to a position in the formation. Small maps of the area were given to each pilot so he could plot the direction to the carrier. All navigation to and from the carries centers on point oboe, the code name assigned to the famed Baha’i Temple, a prominent landmark in Wilmette, Ill. on the shore of lake Michigan. Flight to and from the carrier passed over point oboe. An instructor in an SNJ trainer leads the flight to and from the carrier. I wonder what you would do in combat out in the huge ocean.

We went to the flight line, started our engines and started taxing in the order that the instructor gave us. The leader was Lt. Schaefer at Jacksonville. The reason for a known order was the LSO had to know so he could mark us. When it came time for me to take off, I should have known I was going to have trouble. The minute I got off the ground, the plane started to swing to the left in a sharp turn. I gave it full right rudder and full right stick. I noticed right away that only one of my flaps was down. We usually took of with 30 degrees flaps and I didn’t notice that only one was down. That never happened to me before or after. I kept the nose down to pick up some speed as I was afraid the plane was going to stall out. Still in a steep turn, but going a little faster I raised the flat up at 10 degrees at a time until the flat was up and was o.k. When I got up to a good altitude I tested the flaps and they worked good and at the same time and worked good from then on. We joined up in formation and with the help of the leading plane and instructor, put us on the correct course and soon we saw the carrier, The temperature was very cold and the ceiling was only 200 feet, but we did not have to go very high.

We passed on the right side of the carrier in right formation at 800 feet. As soon as we got a fair distance in front of the carrier the leader signaled he was going to break off and we all did that so we had a good interval and dropping down to about 200 feet putting the wheels and full flaps down and slowing down to about 95 knots.. Looking to the left and as soon as you got even with the rear of the carrier you started your turn. Shortly you looked at the LSO and followed his signals and you better or you would hear about it later. The first signal of the LSO was a roger, meaning you were in good position. The first signal the LSO would give you was being too high or to low and other signals after that. My first landing was a roger all the way and he gave me a cut, meaning to take the power off and land. I thought, boy this is really easy. Wrong. After that I got a few wave offs, meaning to go a round again. One of my landings was very bad. As soon as I got the cut, I pulled the throttle back and my plane turned in a right bank and I hit the deck on one wheel, bounced high, but the hook caught and I went skidding to the right and stopped with my right wheel only one foot from going off the deck. They pulled me back into position and I took off o.k. I finally found out why this happened, but learned the hard way. Part of it was the fault of the LSO. If you are in a Skid when you stall out, one of the wings will drop really quickly. This happened to me at Jacksonville while training. The LSO was supposed to see that and wave you off. You have to keep the ball and bank centered, but difficult to do when you are only looking at the LSO; I was not the last one to get my 8 landings. The leader, Lt. Schaefer was the last one. My total time for that flight was 1.5 hours. Not to bad. The only way you could flunk was to get killed. Making the 8 landings was good enough. Your marks maybe wouldn’t be the best, but you passed. Lt. Com. Peters the LSO marked me satisfactory. His comments were I dropped my left wing and was slow on answering signals. When we got back to field there was a pretty happy bunch of guys, even better than when you soloed.

This only took 2 days of flying, the 9th and 10 of November 1944. Our orders were cut and we were on our way
Okay, here's the final section of the Markdown conversion:

```markdown
the next day. My orders read, in accordance with you basic orders you will proceed to Norfolk, VA. And report to the commander, Air force, Atlantic Fleet, Naval Air Station, at that place for temporary duty involving flying and for further assignment to duty involving flying. Detached 1300, 11 Nov. 1944.

My transfer to the Atlantic fleet was one way to go. The other would be transferred to the Pacific fleet which would be San Diego, Cal. and that is where Gerald Nichols would go after he had qualified on the USS Sable. My friend Robert Thompson would go the same way and as it turned out that was the wrong way for them to go.

The train ride to NAS Norfolk, Va. was the same as the other train rides and the trip to the air station was also the same. The air station at Norfolk was also called Hampton Roads and dates back to before 1918 and was one of the largest air stations in the United States. The station has a lot of history and there are books written on this base. I was there for a little while before they could make up there minds what to do with us.

## CHAPTER THIRTEEN: Naval Air Station Norfolk, and the Naval Air Station Atlantic City, New Jersey

From the 11th of November to December 2nd when I got orders that detached me from the United States Atlantic Fleet and to proceed to the Naval Air Station Atlantic City, New Jersey and to the port in which fighting Squadron Ninety Seven may be and report to the Commanding Officer of the squadron for duty involving flying under instruction. From now on all my mail and address will be to the Air Force Atlantic Fleet. This set of orders was signed by Patrick N.L. Bellinger, naval aviator No. 8 and if I knew who had signed my orders, I would have found a way to talk to him. NAS Atlantic city was only a short distance form Norfolk to that base. From the time I left NAS Glenview, to Atlantic City, almost a month had gone bye. They assigned us to the BOQ. And before I got to the squadron, a month would go bye and in those 30 days, they couldn’t be more mixed up. We sat around and waited and waited.

LT. Bob Brewer was sent to an air station in New York in a pool to ferry planes to California and that was some hairy experience. He and another Lt. were assigned an F6F Hellcat to fly to Cal. and Bob told me, he could have walked to Cal faster than it took them to fly there. Counting bad weather, stopping for gas and other things, it took them about a week to get there. As soon as they landed, they boarded a C-47 to fly back to N.Y. Then he got orders to a squadron to fly F6F- Hellcats and as soon as he got where the squadron was he put in a bitch, that he had trained to fly F4U-Corsairs and would they please transfer him to a squadron that had Corsairs. Air group 95 was forming and somehow he was transferred to that squadron.

I was still on the loose and what happened next, I will never understand. I think a group of us were going to Air group 95. While we were waiting, the Navy decided that some of us were going to the NAS Grosse Ile, Detroit, Michigan. I think at this time we were all in the Air Group 95 at Atlantic City, N.J. Someone decided we would go to NAS Grosse Ile, air station in two different groups and in order to tell who would make the first trip, we pulled names from a hat and I was in the first group. We flew to Detroit in a C-47 which would carry about 30 passengers. I believe this is where the Air Group would be before we would go over seas. This is how the Navy was screwed up. We arrived at the Air Station and were there only 3 days and we got orders to go back to Atlantic City. The second group never arrived. The Air Station was on the Detroit River and was a primary base for training cadets to fly the Bi-plane Stearman. Before this I had orders detaching me from Fighting Squadron 97 to Fighting Squadron 95. These orders were dated December 13th 1944, and this was before I went to Grosse Ile Air Station, which was on the 20th of Dec. These were the orders that were signed by Naval Aviator #8 Patrick N.L Bellenger. We arrived back at Atlantic City the first of January, 1945. I fooled around until the 10th of Jan. when some officer told me to ferry an F6f-Hellcat to the Naval Air Station, Wildwood, NJ Which was at the bottom tip of New Jersey and also close to the Delaware Bay, The Air Station was closer to the Delaware Bay.

## CHAPTER FOURTEEN: N.A.S. Wildwood, New Jersey and the Commissioning of Air Group 95

Wildwood was on a slim strip of land and not much distance from the Atlantic and the Delaware Bay. I had never flown a Hellcat before but now it didn’t matter, as they all flew the same. The Corsair pilots called the Hellcat an old women’s plane. The Air Station at Wildwood was a very nice field. There were 4 runways so most of the landings were cross wind landings, but no big deal. We were commissioned at NAS Wildwood and they took a group picture of us and that would be the first of 3 group pictured taken. The first 17.6 hours of flying was recorded in my log book as Carrier Aircraft Service Unit 24 and in that time I logged 4.1 hours in instrument flying in an SNJ, and was recorded in my log book as qualified in instrument flying.

My address from now on would be Fighting Squadron 95 c/o fleet post office, New York, N.Y. and this would QUALIFY me for the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal, the same as being overseas. At this base we would do mostly gunnery practice. The officer of the day would find out what planes would be operating and assign them to us which would be a flight of 8, as usual. Lt. Robert Brewer told the skipper and others that we should not be flying over the ocean as the planes were too old, especially in the winter time. They were the models from Chance Vought and Goodyear Corp. It seemed that every time we went up. Someone would have trouble. One Day we heard that one of the pilots from our squadron was coming in for a landing and he must have stalled out in his approach and crashed on the runway. The plane broke apart and they found the pilot strapped to the seat in the cockpit that had came loose from the rest of the plane and was lying upside down on the runway. It was days before he regained consciousness and he never remembered anything to do with the flight, not even when he took off. They transferred him to a hospital and I believe out of the navy. What happened, no one knows. It could have been anything, some mechanical failure, pilot error, or he might have passed out. I have a picture of him standing in from of a very old corsair.

There are a lot of things I don’t remember. The mess hall was in a large building for the officers. The waiters were Philippine sailors. The food was very good and they did not serve powered eggs like they did when I was a cadet. You even had some what of a choice and as much as you could eat. I would always rate the food for officers as very good.

We were assigned to a barracks for officers with one roommate and I can’t remember who that was. There were 55 pilots in our squadron and each day we would be assigned to 7 other pilots for that flight and this would change every day. It wasn’t until the Hawaiian Islands, that they assigned us to a permanent group of 8 and we stayed that way until the end of the war. Our squadron would not join the other 3 squadrons until Hilo, Hawaii. These squadrons were training at other fields and it was amazing how they finally got us together as an Air group. I believe that our Air group was the first to fly the corsair at Wildwood NAS.

The field was almost on the Delaware Bay and a very short distance from the town of Wildwood. Wildwood city was a beautiful city and was a resort that many people gathered there in the summer time. In Jan. of course the town was mostly empty. There was a Naval Air Station at Cape May which was a short distance south of wildwood. We flew down there twice to practice field carrier landings, which we did quite often, just in case we had to land on a carrier. Each time we went there, we stayed over night at the officers club and there was always a bit of drinking. Where ever we went, there was never a lack of booze.

One day a flight of Corsair was taxing out to the runway and they were ziging back and forth, and the reason was that was the only way you could see the plane in front of you while taxing. While doing that a High Wing Howard plane taxied into one of the corsairs and the 13-foot prop on the Corsair Sliced through the cockpit of the Howard and cut the legs off the pilot. He died shortly after that. Every time something like that happened we tried not to think too much of it. You couldn’t let these accidents get you down, because it happened so often. It seemed that there were a percentage of accidents that happened, and you could not stop it. Even when you got back to your room or where ever you were going, you did not talk about what happened. At no time did I think of something happening to my plane, like the engine cutting out, or the wings falling off or many other ways to get into trouble.

In the month of January I flew 17.6 hours and 31.6 hours in the month of February and if we got in 20 days out of each month flying, we would be doing well. On one flight out group decided to fly up to the New York area just fooling around. One of the pilot’s named ensign Parker who we called Yo Yo because he flew so close he would be over correcting. The squadron asked us to turn in a nick name we wanted to be called. This was tradition and remains the same today. Some of the nick names of some of our pilots were Nero, L.D. D.L. The skipper was called Sugar Dog after his name Spencer Downs Wright and the name Downs was a family name and everyone called him Downs from other squadrons and all of his friends he knew form other years. Other names were Gunner, Humpy, Deacon, Whiskey Joe, Fussy, Deac, Mouse, La Duke, Honest Joe, Duke, buzz, and his name was James Sawyer. Cisco, Yogie, and I were called Mac.

While we were on this flight, up to New Your, Ensign Parker wanted to fly close enough to touch wings and like a bunch of dummies we did that. It was not as difficult as you would think. Two planes would go into a gentle turn and at a slight angle, one of the planes would get just a little above the other. While in the turn, the lower plane would fly smooth and with no movement. The other plane would fly until the two wings were just over one another. Then the top plane would gently drop his wing and bounce it off the other plane. Needless to say Ensign Parker was a dare devil, which eventually did him in.

One of the other pilots flying with us was Ensign Francis Yanoshik, who we called the mad Russian, or Yogie. As we were flying in formation, I noticed black smoke coming out from the rear of the tail on his plane. I radioed him and told him about it. I could only be one of two things. You could be losing your oil, or a hydraulic leak. I told him he better go back to the base right away, but he said there was nothing wrong. There had to be something wrong so I told him again that he should go back to the base and he finally agreed. At that time I, did not find out what happened to Yanoshik. A couple of years ago, maybe 2002 or close, called him on the phone, He lived near Washington and I reminded him of the incident and he told me that he went back to the base, did not call the tower for landing instructions, barged right in the traffic pattern and landed. Just as he touched down on the runway, the engine froze up because of the lack of oil. He said, thanks a lot Mac, I sure was lucky I wasn’t killed. This would happen again to another pilot later on at another station.

In the Month of February would be the first time that we fired Rockets. They were called 5 inch rockets as that was the diameter. of the rocket. In the cockpit we had switches that would enable us to fire them one or two at a time, or all of them at once. When you fired them, smoke would come out the end and disappear under the plane and it looked like the rocket was doing that, but the rocket went so fast you couldn’t see it go. We only fired rockets 4 times at Wildwood, but would fire many more in the future.

Gunnery would still be the main thing we did. Like at Pensacola, to be a fighter pilot, gunnery was the most important phase. There was always a lot of trouble that could happen. The Sailors who loaded the guns had to be sure that the Bullets were all the same size. If they were not, the guns would jam. The guns on the planes had to be bore sighted. The armors would prop the plane like it was in level flight, and sight the guns to converge at 1000 feet, so if you fired before the 1000 from the target, or after the 1000 feet the bullet would be going in a wide arc from left to right. We had switches for the guns also, and would only fire 2 guns at a time, usually inboard, center, or outboard. When you fired at the target, you only fired 5 or 6 rounds at a time. If you fired more, it would burn out the rifling and the bullet would go all over the place. This happened many times to me and also the jamming. To get to know what was going on, we had to load our own guns from time to time. You laid the sleeves of bullets out on the runway and walked up and down and checked to see if the bullets were all the same. In the sleeve of bullets, every third one was a tracer, so you could see were they were going when you fired them. Some of the guys would turn off all of the guns except one, and instead of firing at 1000 feet which was what you were suppose to do; they would fire the one gun all the way to the target following the tracers. If you got caught, you could get in trouble. Someone watching your plane firing could tell very easy, how many shot you fired. I know in combat, the pilot did not care how long he fired. He was only interested in shooting down the Japes. If you see on T.V. planes firing you know they kept the trigger down a long time. I would. We had gun cameras and would view the film after the flight. Each gun would hold 200 rounds of ammunition, so all told; you could carry 1600 runs of ammunition. Firing only two guns at a time, the ammunition would last a long time. I only fired all 8 guns once, just fooling around. If you couldn’t hit with two guns, you would be pretty bad gunner.

While at NAS Wildwood, we only flew 4 gunnery hops. Other flights were tactical, navigation, carrier practice and rockets. A lot of the time we were just up flying around in formation and building up time. The big thing we were waiting for was our order to be assigned to a carrier and the Fleet. Some of the pilots were ordered directly to the fleet as replacements and that is what happened to Ensign Liles. He would be attached to the USS Intrepid and would see a lot of combat. He is one of the eight that I took operational training at Jacksonville with. More on him later. Every time we went on a gunnery hop, we would be assigned a plane by the duty officer. We had to take turns having that duty. The officer would go out to the flight line and see what planes were available. He would then assign them to each of the pilots for that flight. It was like a lottery. You would be lucky to get a plane that was in good shape. One out of 8. Again the planes were old and not in good shape.

One of the gunnery flights we went on was over the Delaware bay and as usual, we went to our planes, started them and taxied out to the runway single file and turning left and right so we could see the plane in front of us. The tow plane had already left and we would meet him in the planed area. Towing the sleeve was still the most dangerous part of flying. We would take off one at a time with a proper interval, and then we would join up in formation and fly to meet the tow plane. After about a few passes at the sleeve, one of the pilots by the name of Ensign Orville Thorson called us on the radio and said his engine quit. This was January 1945 and the temperature was very low. When his engine quit, it was like the kiss of death. You knew instantly that you would not make it alive. His thoughts would be I am not going to see my mother or my family ever or any other things you would do as the years go by. As he was going down, we all got in a circle and turned on our IFF which mean identification friend or foe on which was a signal to the coast guard so they would be able to locate the plane form the signal. We also called them on the radio. If you were in a warm climate, there was no trouble landing in the water, getting in your life boat and waiting to be picked up. The pilot was setting on the parachute and on top of the chute was a unit about 6 inches thick with the life boat in it and a large knife, water and some candy bars. If you bailed out, the chute package would be gone, leaving the life boat package strapped to the harness. But, when you rode the plane into the water, you had the whole unit together and the only way you could get to the life boat was to jump in the water and separate the two, so you could inflate the life boat. This took precious time, which you didn’t have. The pilot made a good landing and we could see he got the two units separated and had inflated his life rafe, but that is as far as he got. We could see his head dropping into the water. I guess the cold got to him and he didn’t have the strength to get into raft. A Flying boat finally got there and picked him up. It took about 35 minutes for them to get there which was about as good as they could do. We flew back to the base not knowing the out come, and we thought he would be o.k. I was standing on the field when I saw an ambulance coming to the Administration area and we found out that Orville did not make it. The cold was too much for him. So what Lt Brewer ask the skipper to not send us out over the cold ocean because of the poor condition of the planes, came true. This was the first pilot in our squadron to die.

I don’t remember who took his body to his home, but I do know all family he had was his mother and the shock was so bad, they had to take her to the hospital. It’s the family that suffers the most. Before the war would end we lost 10 pilots that I can remember. The other 3 squadrons did not join us until Hawaii, so they trained 6 months somewhere else and I don’t know the number of accidents they had in that time. I am sure there were many. Back to the accident of Ensign Orville Thurston.

When you engine cuts out over the water, you have two choices. The first is to ride the plane done and land in the water or the land. If you are over water and the weather is warm, I think, landing the plane in the water is the best way. We are trained what to do in either case. When you are getting in the plane getting ready for your flight, there are 3 very important things you must do. The navy fitted us with a parachute harness for each of us and with our name printed on it. Before you went to the plane you put this harness on. Getting into the plane the first thing you did was to hook the harness to the chute and seat pack. There is a long strap about 4 or 5 feet long attached to the seat pack, and you hook the strap to your harness. The reason for this is when you are in the water the seat back won’t drift away from you and then you will have no life boat. The second thing you do is turn on the master switch and check how much gas you have and if not a full tank, you don’t take that plane. If you bail out, and as the chute opens up, you still have the seat pack if you attached the strap to you parachute harness.

I think over water during the winter, I would bail out because your Shute is open, leaving the seat pack with you heading down. Now, as you go into the cold water, you have to work as fast as you can to open the seat back, inflate it and crawl into it. I believe I could do it faster that way. Its a choice you have to make and it better be the right one when your life depends on it.

There is an article on the web that tells the story of NAS Wildwood and is titled “Naval Air Station Wildwood at War 1943-1945 and is written by Jeffrey M. Dorwart, Rutgers University. There were 41 airman killed during that time and he lists all of them and what they were flying, the date and where it happened. One of those was Ensign Orville Thorson of Minnesota of our Air Group. The time at Wildwood was very pleasant and the town was a good place to wail away you time. Wildwood New Jersey was a famous resort for people to vacation in the summer time.

## CHAPTER FIFTEEN: NAS Oceana, Virginia

Our next station is at NAS Oceana and is the station where most of the famous squadrons went before they left for combat and that is what we were there for. We would be waiting to be assigned a Carrier and it would be some time before that happened. Here we would be doing dive bombing, rockets, gunnery and many other things. The trip down here was again just like the others. The air station here was then and is still the largest naval base in the United States. The runways were 8000 feet long and we didn’t need that much.

Every flight was a pickup and we did not know who we were going to fly with. Usually a Lt. J.G. would lead the flight and the Ensigns would be the last in the flight, and the further you were back, the more difficult it was to fly in formation, but no trouble. Every morning we would meet at this small building at the end of the field and inside there were only long benches and many times I would stretch out on one of these and go to sleep until time for my flight. The planes were just outside the small buildings. The main air station and large hanger were a long ways from us. I have a few pictures showing this.

I was at this base from the 1st of March to the 14th of May. I flew 56.6 hours in March, 59.6 hours in April, and 40.2 hours in May and that is a whole lot of hours. If you flew 50 hours a month that was considers a lot. We were flying 4 or 5 hours a day. We would go on a hop, come back. Refuel, rearm and go up for the next flight. One day it would be 3 flights of rockets or the next day, 3 flights of gunnery or bombing. This of course in tight 8 plane formation. I got so flying in formation was just automatic. I can’t remember any mid air collisions, but a lot of other trouble.

The air station was near the shore and close to the city of Oceana. There was a tuner Ville trolley that would go from Oceana and the beach right by the gate of the station. It was a beautiful single car that was attached to an electric cable and would wonder all over before it got to the Air Station. The beach did not have many building on it. There were some eating places, not like it is today that is full of Motels, and every thing else. Oceana was very nice in those days. In fact, every place I went was nice. No McDonalds or X rated houses etc.

Most of the guys had a car of some kind. You could get a pretty good car for 100 dollars. Norfolk was about 30 minutes from the base. We were going to practice FCLP at small out lying fields near the main base. We would be practicing the FCLP a number of times as we would be going out to the USS Charger for carrier landings where some of the most famous squadrons made their landings. By the time we arrived at the Naval Air Station, we had done quite a lot of this type of flying.

Our squadron took off joined up and flew to the out lying field that the Navy assigned to us. The landing signal officer was waiting for us at the end of the runway. We passed over him at 800 feet, went a short distance down the runway and broke off one at a time with a proper interval, dropped down to about 5o feet, slowed down to about 90 Knots with full flaps and landing gear down. We would start a turn into the runway and the LSO would instruct us with his Paddles and from then on all you looked at was the LSO and his Paddles. Or flags. If you did well, he would give you the signal to land, and then you stalled the plane, hit the runway and promptly gave full power and took off, making another circle of the field for another attempt at landing. This took an hour and a half to complete all of our landings.

There are signals for to fast, to slow, to high, to low, skidding, landing gear not down, which I already knew about. For what happened to me later on. When the LSO gave us the signal which was called a cut in which the LSO would wave the right hand flag across his chest. When he did that you cut your power and landed. You had to obey the wave off signal. If you didn’t obey the signal, you would be in a lot of trouble, especially when you were landing on a carrier.

I found out, as you were coming up the grove, as they called it, just as you got the first signal from the LSO. You made the first 2 correction really quick and if you did that, it made the landing a lot easier. The closer you got, the more difficult it was to make a correction soon enough.

On the way back to the field we would pass over the runway at 8oo feet in a right echelon and step down position which means you were lower then the plane you were following. As the flight got over the front of the runway the leader would transfer the leadership to the next guy, do a 90 degree turn and a complete circle to the landing. The way you transferred the leader ship was to pat the top of your head with you right hand and point to the next guy. This was a navy tradition. Our interval was so close that when you landed, there were 4 planes on the runway before the first one turned off. As soon as the first plane turned off he would fold his wings and the whole flight would pull into each chock and that would look just like the Blue Angles coming home. I thought it looked very impressive. With the wings being folded upwards in this plane, it looked like a flock of birds coming in.

As the planes were coming in to the final approach and the straight away, you would not have much straight direction and as soon as you straighten out, you would be touching down for your landing. In the 3 months at NAS Oceana I flew 38 gunnery flights and towed the sleeve 7 times. I said before, when you took off to tow the sleeve, you had to do it the correct way or you would damage the sleeve and then you would have to land and try it again. I remember one guy had to take the sleeve off 3 times before he got it right. I never had to do that.

There was a P-47 army base near bye and they would fly over our base really low, about 10 feet above the building and throw toilet paper all over the place. Naturally we would fly over their base going down their runways about 10 feet off the ground also.

Another time when I was flying on the wing of the skipper, we met a squadron of P-47s and they started to fool around with us. The skipper gave me the sign to follow him, we pulled to within a couple of feet the P-47 and the skipper thumbed his nose at the P-47 pilot. Where ever the army pilot went the skipper stayed right on him. The army pilot began to get a little scared. I stayed with the skipper but not as close as he was to the army pilot. Lt. Com. Wright was the best pilot I ever saw.

I was downtown Oceana about a block from the beach and was looking toward the water when a Corsair, then a P-47 with about 5 or six of each following each other about 10 feet off the water, traveling down the beach going about 300 miles per hour or faster. What they didn’t know was the Skipper was at a party on the beach with Admiral A. C. Read who was giving a party. He was known as a first class ass hole. He was also the pilot of the NC-4, the only plane to first fly the Atlantic in 1919 and he got many medals from Spain and the British. He was the only one of 4 planes to make it. He said to Lt. Com. Wright, get their names. It took about a week before our pilots admitted that they were the ones. This happened just before we were leaving the base for California. All of us got 3 days leave, and they were put on a troop train straight to California. One of the pilots was Lt. Robert Brewer who stayed in the Navy after the war and only got to be A Commander before he retired. He was written up in his Navy flight jacket for the beach incident and he thinks that is the reason he didn’t go to a higher in rank. Probable not true. Not every officer got to be a Captain. The skipper always told us not to let the P-47s get the best of you. Admiral A.C. Read was Naval Aviator # 24 and was Commandant of NAS Pensacola in 1942.

We were getting ready for carrier landings on the USS Charger and on the 17th of March I flew two flights of Field Carrier Landing Practice. Where the field was I didn’t know. It was impossible to practice FCLP at the main air station because of the huge traffic problem like at NAS Jacksonville with a plane landing every 3 minutes for 3 years. I guess I did o.k. on the practice.

The next day 4 of us went to the USS Charger to make 8 landings. They only sent 4 of us at a time, instead of 8. This worked better and was a shorter traffic pattern. I made all 8 landings with out a wave off. I only got one wave off after my landings in Chicago and that was at night. The next 4 days I had two gunnery flights and towed the sleeve once and a 2.7 flight at night.

The night flights were very intense having to stay in formation and staring at the lights for at least 2 hours. Easy to get vertigo. In fact I did get vertigo, as we were letting down for our landing. Instead of a smooth let down, the leader came down very steep and in a sharp turn most of the way. I really didn’t believe you could get vertigo. We had meetings showing us how this could happen and staring to long was one way you could get it. We were told to look at the lights on plane you were flying on and shift your eyes really quick to another area and back again. As we were letting down, I noticed that I was all alone and was following a light on a ship out to sea. If you look in some distance, the lights seem to be at the same level as you are. I got out of my trance, realizing what was happening and made it back to the base on my own. One of the guys asked me where I had gone and I made some excuse. I told you about the 2 cadets that flew in formation into the ground at Pensacola. Night flying is not for the timid.

On the 24th, 4 of us were on our way to the carrier and about half way there a Captain on a destroyer in the Bay called us on the radio and asked us if we could make some passes on the Destroyer so they could train their guns on us. No sooner had he finished his message, we were on our way down from about 5000 feet going single file with a short space between us. We passed the destroyer just a few feet above their super structure, climbed straight up to the 5000 feet, rolled over on our backs and came down again and again. That is the most fun I ever had flying. When we were through, the Captain called us and said that we did a super job and thanked us. I think the Captain of the Destroyer called the skipper and him what a good job we did. When we got back to the base the skipper said “what the hell were you guys doing” as this was against all the rules. We just said we were obeying out superiors. We went on to the carrier and made 4 landings in about 15 minutes with no wave offs and the Captain of the carrier called us and said we did a super job. Lt Robert Brewer was along on this flight and every time I called him on the phone in recent years, he would bring this story up and the P-47 deal also. I guess you don’t forget these special events.

On the 27th of March we had a Field Carrier Landing practice at night. The night before we were to make our two night landing on the carrier. FCLP at night will separate the men from the boys. I would say that it would be close to the most dangerous flying you could do. This would be at an auxiliary field also. There were no lights on the runway and trees all over the place. We did our usual break off to get our interval and would do touch and goes until we finished. Just before we were coming up the grove, we had to drop down lower than the trees in our approach. The only lights were the florescent suit the LSO and his Paddles had. We all made it o.k. which I think we were pretty lucky. This is why the test for your eye sight was so important and the color blindness test for sure. If you couldn’t tell the red light on the right wing and green on the left wing, you would not know which side of the plane you would be on.

The reason we had to make 2 landings on the carrier at night was in early June 1944 in the carrier battle of the Philippine Sea and what was called the Marianas Turkey Shoot June 19-20. There was a battle that started on the 19th of June with an attack on task force 58 by Japanese land-based planes from Guam and Truk. Hellcat fighters from our carriers destroyed 35 enemy fighters and bombers .The remainder of battle was fought by 430 Japanese carrier planes attacking the 450 planes of task force 58 in four fierce waves. At the end of the eight hour onslaught, only 100 of the Japanese enemy planes returned to their carriers. The rest had been destroyed in the most decisive aerial combat in history. All of the planes from task force 58 took off late in the day and they knew they would not get back before it turned dark. None of the pilots had been qualified in night carrier landings. When planes were coming back to the carrier and straggling in groups of two or three. Planes started to go down in the water. Others planes circled, trying to find their carriers. It was then that Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher gave a four word order that made him the most beloved admiral in the Navy. “Turn on the lights”. Immediately, every ship in the fleet turned on its searchlights and pointed the beams skyward. The glow from nearly 200 searchlights could be seen for a hundred miles. Many pilots were lost. The planes were landing on any carrier they could find and a lot of the planes crashed and burst into flames. One of the pilots called on the radio and said you are going to lose one of the best pilots in the Navy, and was not seen again. Because of the huge number of Japanese planes, there were over 20 pilots who became aces. This is where Com. David McCampbell became the top scoring ace in the Navy with 37 planes shot down, most of them in this battle. This was so historic, that if you type Admiral Marc Mitscher and Turn on the lights in the computer, you will get the whole story. After this, the navy came out with a directive saying every navy pilot will have to make two landings at night on a carrier.

The landings on the carrier at night were bad enough, but practicing on the out lying fields at night was far worse. There were 70 aircraft that crashed in the water during the battle of the Philippine Sea. On the 27th of March we had two flights of FCLP

at an auxiliary field and the next day we went out to the carrier, the USS Charger in the Chesapeake Bay. To make our night landings In order to get to the carrier, we were directed by radar from the carrier, plus some navigation from our group.

On the carrier each deck hand had only his job to do. They worked as a team and you had to follow their order to the tee. As you were coming up the grove, there were 3 deck hands with the LSO and they each of them had there job to do. As the plane was coming in for the final approach, one of the deck crew would be saying deck fouled, and keep repeating that phrase until the deck was clear of the previous plane that had landed. another crewman would be saying wheels down, tail hook down as the LSO had all he could do to bring the plane in. In the center of the carrier there were 3 sets of two Cables propeller high going across the deck. There was a deck hand that could drop the 3 set of cables that would go down flat with the deck. There were usually 11 wires that your hook on the plane could catch. To catch anyone of the wires would be alright. If you caught the 11th wire you could still go into the barrier or cables. If you missed all of the arresting gear cables and went into the barrier, you would probably flip over on the back of the plane and that would be the end of the landings for that time.

Also our interval was 30 seconds apart and the pilots did there best to stick to that. As soon as you plane hit the deck, another deck hand would be standing to the right of the plane and his job was to give you the hook up signal and pointing to the front of the ship, you would give full throttle to get past the barrier which was down by then, and as soon as you passed that area, the deck hand would raise the barrier and the deck hand with the LSO would tell him the deck cleared and the next plane would be landing just as the plane cleared the barrier. A lot of things could happen and did. If the Plane landing would hit too hard and bounced over the barrier, he could land on top of the plane that had just cleared the barrier. There were cases of a plane taking a wave off too late and the hook would catch the barrier prop high and come crashing to the deck ripping the tail off the plane

You got pretty good giving full throttle to go past the barrier. You would have to pull the throttle back and start getting on the breaks like right now. If you are doing landings and take offs for each landing, the flag officer would give you signals to go to the spot for take off. This was done with much speed to keep the 30 second interval. The flag officer would get you to the spot, give you the full throttle signal and when you tail was starting to bounce of the deck he signaled you to take off. All this was done so fast you hardly had time to thing of anything else.

If you were in the ready room and you got the signal to man your planes, there would be a different procedure to follow. I will tell this later. I know in combat this was an intense time. We had lectures for this all the time, plus the LSO would give us the business after the each flight and he could ream anybody’s ass out including an Admiral. I know today there are only 3 wires as there current system is so accurate. If today you don’t meet the requirements. You will be gone from carrier operation.

One of our pilots, Ensign Daily would have a bad time coming up the grove. If you drew a line straight down the middle of the deck into space, you were not supposed to go to the right of the line and you would get a wave off. This is what Ensign Daily would do a lot and the skipper would ream his ass out. After arriving at the carrier, we would travel down the right side of the carrier at 800 feet altitude and break off to get our 30 second intervals. Getting down to 50 feet off the water in the dark was a bit harrowing. One of the methods you used going down wind before you got to the grove was to sight at your left wing tip and put it so you could see the carrier at the tip of the wing like sighting a gun to a target, and that got you the right spacing and distance from the carrier. It got pretty easy after while. Like I said, getting set up really quick helps out a lot. I use to go up in the island at the top and watch landings. You have never seen anything so exciting for both take offs and landings. My first landing was really good. I got a wave off on the second try and made the third one o.k. There were only 4 of us and when we were finished, we joined up and went back to the base. I was really happy to get that out of the way. Some of the guys had to go back a second time to qualify.

One of the pilots in our air group forgot to put his tail hook down and the deck hands did not catch it. He hit the deck, bounced over the barrier and into the water at the end. A Small ship always followed at the rear of the carrier and to the right. The ship picked the pilot up out of the water. They got him out so fast he hardly had time to get wet. I can’t remember who that was.

On our bombing flights, we would go to a target that was on the beach in a safe area. The target was a white circle about 200 feet in dia. For each flight there would be one of us of the flight of 8 who would fly around the target at 1000 feet and record the hits of the other 7 pilot’s dropping their bombs. The pilots would start their run about 20,000 feet and would have a close interval coming down, so the pilot marking the hits would have his hands full and mark the hits one, two, three etc. so that way you would know each pilots score. There would be someone on the ground watching us and would be in radio contact. We were supposed to dive at an angle of 70 degrees or steeper. In order to do that we had to have the plane pointed straight down as the wind would move you and this would take away some of the angle. They would call me and tell me I was not steep enough and the only way I could get more of an angle was to fly inverted.

One of the crazy things that was done was Lt Dierker would fly the formation in a dive right at the tower and just before we got to the tower about 50 feet high, Lt. Dierker would call the tower and ask for permission to buzz the tower just as we were going bye. He could get away with it being a full Lt. The skipper would always keep tabs on the pilots to see if they made tail first landings as if you were landing on a carrier and you would hear about it. Once we caught him making a wheel first landing and as he was walking back, we gave him the business, but all he did was raise his pant legs like he was walking through shit. He was funny sometimes.

On one bombing mission, a pilot named Ensign Berry was the one who was doing the scoring. He was flying around the target when he lost altitude for not paying attention and his wing hit the water just off shore, He did some cart wheels and crashed in the water just off shore. He got out of the plane o.k. and got into his life raft, and inflated it, but he must have hit his head and had trouble getting into the life boat. When he got in the raft, he would keep falling out of it. The waves were pretty high. The leader of the flight was Lt. John Dierker and he called for a flying boat to come and pick Ensign Berry out of the water. When the flying boat got there which was a PBM, a rather large plane. It was bigger than a PBY which was one of the main flying boats of the war. The PBM flew around the area but would not land the plane because the pilot said the water was to rough. Lt. Dierker got on the radio and what he said to the pilot was not repeatable. Some more time went bye and you could tell that Ensign Berry was not doing good. Finally Lt. Dierker was going to land his plane in the water beside Berry, jump out and try to help him. He was in his approach and about ready to land in the water when the pilot of the flying boat said he would land and pick the pilot up. It took some more time for him to do this and finally landed and got the pilot aboard. Again it was too late as Ensign Berry had drowned by that time. This was the second of our group to get killed. There was a memorial for him and Jake Apelbaum took his body to his home. Jake lives in Akron, Ohio, which is near me and we have lunch together every two or three weeks. He is now 84 years old and can hardly walk. He may be going around in a wheel chair soon. He drives o.k. but I am a little scared to ride with him, so I do the driving when I can. Because he took Ensign Berry to his home to be buried, he missed his chance to qualify on the carrier at night. He would have to qualify later and I will have more to tell about that. He told me about the funeral of Ensign Berry and how sad it was, especially when he gave the flag to his mother.

My memory is not too good about some of the things we did when we were not flying. We had to keep busy some way. We use to gather in one of the rooms and have bull sessions. Some of the time we would play back gammon, mostly for 50 cents a game. Back Gammon was a standard game for the navy and was in all of the ready rooms, the board would be painted on all of the tables, both on land and in the ready rooms on the carriers. In combat the squadron would wait in the ready rooms for hours waiting for their call to man their planes. They would be dressed in their flying gear at that time and could be playing cards or back gammon or just sleeping.

When one of our flights would land and as they were coming in to the chocks, they would be folding there wings and that was a pretty sight. There is a plane captain that brings you into the chocks with hand signals. Everything you do on the ground with the plane is directed by some ground crew. When you shut the engine off you, you first increase the throttle to about 10 inches of mercury; pull the mixture back and the engine cuts out. I always liked to do that. The sound is something you don’t forget, especially when the 13 foot propeller stops rotating.

Just as the engine quit, I looked in front of the plane and saw my twin brother Don standing there. Was I surprised? He just shows up without telling any one. Don was stationed at Camp Perry, Virginia and was a Pharmacist Mate 1st class. He had enlisted in the navy 3 months before the war started and was in San Diego, California when the war started and it wasn’t long before he was overseas and was stationed near Guadalcanal. He was there for a couple of years and saw most of the wounded that came from the islands. At this time, he was back from overseas and was going to school to learn more medical facts etc. My friends were surprised to see someone that looked just like me. Don wanted to know if I could take him for a plane ride and I said that was no problem. I checked out a SNJ for the ride. Don really enjoyed the flight and I think he would have made a very good pilot.

While he was at the base, the squadron was going to have a party in Norfolk Virginia and I got permission to take him to the party. Like most of the parties, there was a lot of drinking and it gets out of hand a lot. My skipper got so drunk, that he was dancing without shoes on. another incident happened that really pissed me off. I had the duty one day and at about 5 o’clock I left to go into town. Every body had gone their own way and there was no one to take messages. When other officers had the duty, especially the married, they would go into town or where ever they lived. Sometime during the evening, a message came in from the USS Charger and they wanted 4 planes to make landings at 9 o’clock in the morning. I was the one who was supposed to take the message. When I showed up in the morning I got holy shit. They gave me the duty for a full week and I had to stay over night at the base. I was lucky to get off with only that much punishment. Lt Stockstead, who was in personal and not a pilot gave me the business and told me I should have read the bulletin board. He also said the whole bunch of us was smart asses and I guess he was right. When you are young you do things like that and the older officer’s get upset. I found out Lt Stockstead was an alcoholic and after the war, he committed suicide. I think something as important as staying over night when you had the duty should have been discussed in a meeting. Our squadron should have been out to the West coast long before this and finally we got our order to go to San Francisco, California to the NAS Alameda.

## CHAPTER SIXTEEN: On our Way to California and Possibly to Combat

I had a 3-day leave before I was to report to NAS Alameda The trip by train across the country was again very boring, a conformable way to travel. Just sleeping most of the way. I left Oceana about the 22 of May and reported to Alameda the 26th of May 1945. We were there only a couple of days when we got orders to report to the NAS Twenty Nine Palms, California for rocket training. We were there to shoot 6 tiny Tim rockets which were 16 feet long and weighed 1000 lbs. Why we went to NAS Alameda and then to Twenty Nine Palms were a mystery. NAS Twenty Nine Palms was 450 miles south of San Francisco and 100 miles East of Las Angles. We could have gone to Twenty Nine Palms first and would have saved a lot of time and traveling. My thinking is, we were supposed to get a carrier at San Francisco and go to combat and something happened to change their minds.

We left Alameda the 1st of June and were transported to the air station at Twenty nine palms. We went to Twenty Nine Palms in a C-47 twin engine plane. It took 2 planes to get all of us to the air station. The plane traveled over the Sierra Nevada mountain range and across the length of the Mojave Desert. This was close to highway 10. I thought the plane was going to brake up and crash. The thermals were so bad; I couldn’t even stay on my seat which was a flat bench. The plane landed just before I got sick. The runway at the field was made of heavy wire mesh that is laid on the desert floor. There was only one runway so you could be making a cross wind landings some of the time During June, the weather was very hot and there were a lot of thermals in the air making it impossible to fly in the afternoon. The thermals could shake the plane almost to pieces. You would have to have your shoulder harness on very tight. Before we shot the tiny Tim rockets, we had to fire the HARV 5 inch rockets and that was on the 5th, 6th 7th and 8TH OF June. We flew early in the morning and quit flying at 12 o’clock noon because of the heavy updrafts and thermals. Our approach to landings was always the same. The first turn into runway was very sharp and steep and as you were coming into the final approach, there was a less of a bank. This looked scary from the ground but was the safest way to land. We scared the hell out of the guy in the tower who was screaming at us about the crazy way we landed. We always had 4 planes on the runway before the first on turned off and we pulled into the chocks while folding our wings and it looked very impressive.

On the 8th of June I fired 2 tiny Tim’s. The tiny Tim rockets were 16 feet long and weighted 1000 pounds. When you carried two of those rockets, which would be 2000 lbs, it would feel like you were flying behind a barn door. A B-25 twin engine medium bomber would only carry a little more than this. On the 9th I fired 4 tiny Tim’s. I made 2 flights to do this. I know the carriers were being stocked with these rockets. The USS Franklyn was carrying these rockets when it was hit with bombs and started to explode with the tiny Tim’s going off all over the place. This happened while we were at Twenty Nine Palms in June and this was the reason we didn’t get this ship. Not many pilots could say they fired tiny tims.

In the mean time, out pilots being bored tried to do different things to pass the time of day. One of these was to get a jeep and with 4 guys loaded with 45 calibers pistols, would go out into the desert to shoot jack rabbits. Some of the pilots were standing around looking at the mountain ranges and would get into an argument about how far they were form us. One of the guys would say he could get there in 30 minutes and then they would bet on it. One of the pilots was picked to run to the mountain range and the rest would bet whether he could or could not make it. Some times he would and other times he wouldn’t make it in time.

Our barracks were one story buildings on a cement slab and looked a lot like a motel. One day one of the pilots got caught fooling around with one of the nurses in the outdoor handball court. His wife had a fit, but she got over it. What was she going to do? She said she loved him any way.

I know the marines in combat fired the tiny Tims at targets on an island directed by marines on the ground. They would start their run going into the target at a slight angle, like they would be strafing. When we fired the rockets we went into a steep dive, 70 degrees or more and that was a stupid way to do it. I never found out where my rockets hit and was happy to get it over with.

Now this is unbelievable. We got our orders to go back to NAS Alameda. Some of the pilots had cars and would travel in groups to their destinations. Not having a car I had to travel to Alameda on the train. If you watch the old movies you can see the train station at Los Angles California. One of our pilots, Lt. J.g. Eugene Schierenberg checked out a SBC Helldiver and he and I flew to Las Angles and landed at some airport a long ways from downtown L.A. and I took a street car to the train station in downtown L.A, which took a long time? As I was traveling on the street car I noticed that that the stop signs had a long arm that would flip out horizontal and a loud bell would ring. One arm would say stop and the other one would say go. These arms were about 2 feet long. How antique. My train trip was to San Francisco and across the bay to NAS Alameda. This is where all of us met and we found out we were going to Hawaii on the USS Wasp. The navy had small boats going back and forth from Alameda to San Francisco and I did that a few times before we left.

## CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: Our Trip on the USS Wasp to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii

When we boarded the ship, they assigned us our sleeping quarter. The officers with a higher rank shared a room with another officer and had much better quarters than the lower ranked officers. They assigned me to a room with a full Lt. and my bed was a cot in the center of the room and that is where I stayed until we got to Hawaii, which would take 5 days. It was always a great sight to see how the carrier got under way. A couple of tug boats would hook up to the carrier and transport the carrier out of the bay to open waters away from incoming and out coming traffic. As soon as we got to the proper area, the tug boats released the carrier and with horns blowing and we would head out to sea. We traveled under the Oakland bay bridge and then under the Golden Gate bridge to the Pacific Ocean.

Not long after we had left the bay, the weather turned very bad. The waves were flying over the deck and the carrier was going back and forth to the left and right and the hanger deck railing was going into the water. If you were standing on the hanger deck near the railing, you could touch the water with your hands. If the weather was good, you would be 10 or 15 feet above the water line. I was in the officer’s lounge looking at a Life magazine when a sailor told me not to pay attention to what the ship was doing and you would not get sick. Wrong, as that didn’t work for me and it wasn’t long before a sailor and I were throwing up at the railing on the hanger deck. I was sick for 2 days before I started coming out of it. The ship was going back and forth so much that the water was coming out of the toilets and all over the deck. The experienced sailor told us that this was the worst weather that had happened in a long time.

After a while I would go up to the flight deck and take deep breaths hoping I wouldn’t get sick again. It took quite a while traveling around the carrier before I learned where to go. There was a focal bunk room in the bow of the carrier that had about 15 double deck bunks and quite large with a table in the center of the room. This is where a card game would be going 24 hours a day and night. It was impossible to get some sleep. The lights never went out. Card games were always going on regardless where you were. The pilots couldn’t live with out this.

After about 3 days out to sea, the carrier started to perform flight operations and air group 86, the permanent air group would practice most of the way across the ocean to Hawaii. This was the air group’s second tour. The carrier had two sets of 5 inch guns mounted in the front and in the rear and twin 50 caliber guns mounted in the cat walk from about the center to the rear of the ship. In the island at all levels, there were 40 twin millimeter guns or sometimes called pom-poms. One day I was standing in one of the 40 millimeter gun mounts, when all of the guns started shooting at a drone going by the carrier about 2000 feet high. I couldn’t hear for sometime. Early in the morning, flight operations would start with catapulting the front planes and then the rest would take off under their own power. The noise was tremendous. No sleeping when this was going on. This would happen two or 3 times a day. They didn’t give the air group any rest. Air group 86 flew the same type of planes that we did. They flew Corsairs, Hellcats, Helldivers, and torpedo planes. Our air group had 180 pilots and 133 crewmen. The torpedo planes had a crew of 3 and the helldiver had 2 crewmen. This whole group stayed together until the end of the war.

I would go up into the island and watch the operations, both landings and launging of the planes. This was the most interesting part of the operation that you could see. I have already said something about the landings of the planes and the launching, or take offs of the air group. The interval in take offs was faster than 30 seconds. In combat, when they would sound the alarm over the load speakers, Pilots, man your planes and the pilots and crewmen, already in their flight gear would dash for the entrance to the flight deck. Every plane would have a plane captain and he would give you the signal to start the engine. If you had trouble in starting the engine, the Captain of the ship who was in the upper part of the island would wait only a couple of minutes. If the plane would not start, the Captain would order the deck hands to push the plane over board. Nothing was allowed to happen that would slow the launching of the planes. This would put a lot of stress on the pilot and sometimes he would give the signal that everything was o.k. when it was not. Everything was timed. I was lucky that my engine started every time. This happened quite often in combat.

I was up early every morning to watch the flight operations. One morning, when it came time for this pilot to get into position for take off, he gave the signal that that his oil pressure had not come up to the proper spot on the dial, which was in the area that was colored green. When you got into the cockpit and started the engine, the oil gage was the first thing you looked at. If it wasn’t right, you shut the engine off right then. Seems like, after a while, most plane leaked oil somewhere. The Captain was getting upset and the pilot knew this. I know what he was feeling. At the time I knew who the pilot was but can not remember now who he was. The pilot decided to take a chance and gave the plane captain the thumbs up sign that he was ready to go and they let him take off. As soon as he cleared the end of the deck, his engine cut out and he went into the water quite steep and then disappeared along the side of the carrier and then to the rear. It would take the destroyer quite a few minutes to get to plane and to pick him up. The plane went under the water almost instantly and the pilot did not get out. This was the first of many accidents that would happen before we got to Hawaii. The pilot of the downed plane was on his 3rd cruise on his own request. Usually, you only had to make 2 cruises into combat.

To watch the coordination of the deck crew was something that was very exciting. Each crewman had his own job to do. They had to go to school to learn their specialty. Where the LSO, the landing signal officer stood, their was a shield behind him so the wind would not push him out of place and to the right of him and a few feet lower was a net that he could jump into if a plane was coming at him. That was better than jumping into the water. When the incoming pilot was not answering his signals sometimes he would walk out to the center of the deck and be more emphatic with his signals and the incoming pilot knew the LSO was upset. When the pilot got a wave off, he must add throttle instantly, make a left turn and get the hell out of there and then come around for another try.

Half of the squadrons had previous combat experience and when you were in the ready room, or in the barracks, the younger pilot would be pumping the veterans, trying to find out some of their experiences. It was on this carrier that I bought the knife that I carried with me in the plane. The knife was a safety factor in case you had to cut your way out of the airplane, or when you went down in the ocean, you could use it for anything needing cutting. Some of the pilots had fancy knives and special helmets of all colors. Some of the guys had high boots etc. The conditions on the ship were first class. Years later, my twin brother was looking at a life magazine showing the dining room on the carrier during the war. The tables had linen table cloths and there were waiters for us. He asked me if that was the way it was when I was there and I said it sure was and he said “you son of a bitch”. Can you imagine going to war with luxury like that with soldiers fighting in the worst of conditions and sleeping in fox holes? We didn’t have it to bad, but the risks were not good. When the carrier was traveling, most of the flight operations were done so the ship could practice what they would do in combat, but mostly the carrier wanted to practice their operations.

On the second day out when they were lounging planes on the catapults, one of the pilots was just getting the signal that they were going to shoot him off, when he notice that the red tab on his wings was still sticking up and you could see the expression on his face that he had made a mistake. If the red tab was sticking up, it was a signal that the wings would not be locked. The pilot has a hand lever in the cockpit to pull up and then the red tabs on the wings would go down, indicating that the wings were locked. The red tabs do not lock the wings as they lock automatically. If you pull the lever and the tabs don’t go down, the wings are not locked. The pilot of this plane must have not pulled the lever and noticed too late, that the red tabs were still up Just as the plane cleared the end of the deck, the wings folded and started to spin around and the plane went into the water with a terrific force. The pilot was unable to get out and that was number 2 lost. The plane disappeared along the side of the carrier and it was difficult to watch what happened. The carrier could not stop and pick him up. Only the destroyer in the back ground had a chance to pick the flyer up, but not much of a chance.

Accidents will happen while flying and this is why you are paid half of your base salary. Other parts the Navy also paid this amount, such as in the submarine service. This was called hazard pay. In my case I was making 150 dollars per month and my hazard pay was 75 dollars.

The ship would like to practice their radar and to do this, they would send a squadron of 8 planes out in the area far enough, about 100 miles and them the planes turn around and attack the carrier from a direction so the carrier could pick them up on their radar. The planes could not attack the carrier, so the ship would put a raft or a platform quite large attached to a cable that would be about a few hundreds yards back of the ship. When the planes came back, they would attack the skid, by dropping bombs and machine gunning it. They would also send out another flight of 8 planes to attack the incoming planes as if they were in combat. This was very dangerous, as many times there would be a collision of some of the planes.

I would be up in the island watching to see the incoming planes and they would always come out of the sun and they were impossible to see. Before you would see the planes, you would hear the bombs going off and the machine guns firing. The attacking planes made a few passes at the skid, when all of a sudden, 2 torpedo planes collided above the skid and both planes hit the water at the same time with a large explosion and 2 pilots and 4 aircrew man died instantly. This makes 4 pilots and 4 aircrew men who were killed in what they called operational fatalities, and not combat. The percentage of operational deaths was like 6 to 1. Before we reached Pearl Harbor another corsair pilot was lost when his engine cut out on take off and could not be reached. This made 9 lives lost in 3 days. If this would continue, the air group would lose all there pilots and aircrew in a couple of months. What was really sad was it wouldn’t be long before the war would be over. This air group would just get to the combat area as the war ended.

As the carrier approached Pearl Harbor, you could see Diamond Head, a famous land mark at Pearl Harbor. The inlet to Ford Island where we were going to dock was very narrow. Ford Island was circled by water and you could go in and out in a circle. As we were about to dock, we passed the USS Arizona and were so close you could almost touch the ship. The super structure was sticking about the water and was getting rusted looking. It was sad to think, that there was over 1000 sailors down there. Docking the USS Wasp was not like bringing a 30 foot sailboat into a birth. They brought the ship in very slow with the help of the tug boats and it was quite a sight to see. The Captain had a lot of responsibility. One miss calculation and he would be doing shore duty. Just as soon as it was docked, the gang planks would be put down and soon after that the crew would be leaving the ship for some fun. As they were leaving, they would salute the officer of the deck and then the flag. This was tradition and no one would leave with out doing this. Some of the sailors would salute very fast in a hurry to get ashore and others would stop and salute in a smart manner and was nice to see. When returning to the ship, you would salute the flag first and the officer of the deck last. The officer of the deck was the one who had a tough job, as he had to salute all the sailors.

## CHAPTER EIGHTEEN: On the Way to the Big Island, Hilo, Hawaii - Till the End of the War

There was a transport docked near the Wasp and we were ordered to board that ship for our transportation to Hilo Hawaii, where we would be for the next 4 months waiting for our carrier for combat and would be training everyday. I don’t remember the name of the ship, but it was like the ships that would transport supplies and people to the combat areas. The ship was quite large and it took only 8 hours to get to Hilo.

Hilo was called the big island and was located on the west side of the island of Hawaii, and was at the base of the large volcano, Mauna Kea which is about 13796 feet high and the taller of the two volcanoes. The air base was located only a short distance from downtown Hilo and you could walk there in about 15 minutes. The base had a beautiful officers club and the swimming pool was as nice as I have ever seen. I would spend a lot of time there and in the officers club playing pool and drinking wine. We would set a bottle of wine on each corner of the pool table while playing pool. The officer’s mess hall was located near the club and was very nice and had the same kind of waiters as all the other bases. You notice I say mess hall, as this is what the navy called the eating area. There were quite a lot of wooden barracks near by and our squadron got one of these and the other 3 squadrons got one for each of the squadrons. The barracks were 2 stories high and the upstairs was the same as the downstairs and they had a lounge in the center of each floor. The lounge was occupied almost continuous with a card game and a lot of drinking and hollering. The most popular card game was red dog. It was a very simple game and you could lose a lot of money on one hand. There were other games that the dealer decided on. We were allowed 2 fifths of whiskey and 2 bottles of wine each month and if you couldn’t drink your allotment, you would find someone who could, especially Lt.Jg. Wallace Daughtry. He was the pilot who I flew with the entire time at Hilo He was on his 2nd tour.

The NAS Hilo became an international airport after the war and there is nothing left of the base as we knew it. The officers club and the mess hall and barracks are all gone. When we were there, the base had all of the trees and forest with the buildings put into opening of the trees. I think all of this is gone also. The runways are the same as you couldn’t change this because of the small flat area. There was a 9 hole golf course 3 miles up the Volcano Mauna Kea. My 2 friends, Ensign Joe Massey and Ensign John Goodens would get the 2 ton truck and we would use this truck to get to the golf course. You would have to double clutch to change gears and the cabin was covered with cloth or fabric. To get to the golf course, you would go down the main street of Hilo for about a couple of blocks to the end and make a sharp left turn and you would be going uphill. We took turns driving and would leave the transmission in high gear and go as fast as you could uphill until you would have to change gears. We would stop and mark the spot and each time we would try to beat the mark. The driving was really wild.

The golf course had a nice club house and there would be Hawaiian kids trying to be a caddie or selling golf balls. Because the course was up hill, most of the holes were going across the hill and maybe one up hill and more across the hill until you got to the 9th hole. The last hole was like teeing off from a cliff and was about 6oo yards to the green. Because of the height, you could hit the ball about 400 yards downhill. All around the golf course was sugar cane and if you hit a ball into that area, you would lose it. The sugar cane was so sharp, you could cut your hands. The Hilo country club today is an 18 hole course and is advertised as a pretty good golf course. I have a number of pictures of the course and caddies.

Lt.J.G. Daughtry was the pilot who I flew with. I was his wingman. He was a heavy drinker and was drunk most of the time when we were flying. One day, as were flying close to the water just off shore when he made a sharp turn to the left. There was no where for me to go, being that close to the water so I pulled back on the stick and hit top rudder which kept me from going down and managed to pull away from him.

He picked up a girl one night, and went to some motel and because she wouldn’t put out, he set the place on fire and he was burned pretty good on his back. Because of this, he spent a couple of months in the hospital and I flew without a leader during that time, which was o.k. with me. He was always using the extra chits I had for whiskey etc. One of my friends in the Hellcat fighter squadron was taking off when his engine cut out. We were told when this happens because of the low wing loading, to keep the plane going straight ahead. It was not possible to turn the plane

180 degrees and go back to the field without engine power as you would stall out and spin into the ground. This pilot decided to try to turn back to the field. There is always a temptation to do this, trying to survive. Just as soon as he turned, the plane stalled out and spun into the ground. There wasn’t much left of him. I heard they picked part of his head out of the instrument panel. It takes nerve to stay going straight ahead. Even that would not do any good, unless the ground was flat and no buildings etc. As soon as the engine cuts out you must get the nose down in order to keep flying speed and we were trained in that in our early training. The instructor would pull the throttle back and if you didn’t get the nose down really quick, he would rape you knuckles with something.

I was flying on a navigation flight of about 3 hours with our squadron and was returning when the red light on my gas gage came on, which meant I had 50 gallons of gas left and had to switch to that reserve. Because I was flying in the eighth position, you would use more gas than the rest of the planes. You would be constantly moving the throttle back and forth to stay in position. The number 2 plane would hardly have to do this. I called the skipper and told him what was happening and he said “SO”. I didn’t know how far we were from the field and was a bit nervous. we were getting close to the field, flying at 800 feet and was starting to circle it when my engine cut out. There was a runway about 30 degrees to my left, so I dropped my landing gear and flaps as fast as I could and without using ailerons’, I used the rudder to inch my plane around to line up with the runway and was really to close. I was going down very steep, leveled the plane off and hit the runway o.k. Because I was so close, to the runway and after I touched down, I had to pump the brakes back forth and barely stopped in front of the fire truck, which was waiting for me. The skipper had called the base and told them of my troubles. If the engine had quit a few seconds before, I would have gone into the water and if it had been a couple of seconds later, I would have gone into the mountain. They checked the gas tank with a long stick and there was no gas left at all. I was pretty lucky. Looking back, it was the skipper’s fault, staying out too long with no margin of error. But, being young, I did not say anything about it, but should have.

It seemed like drinking was going on all the time. One day at noon, just before we were to have lunch, the whole squadron started to drink and it wasn’t long before everyone of us were smashed. Someone suggested we line up and count off, like they did in the army, We lined up in front of the fish pond and counted off as they did in the army and one of the senior officers marched us to the mess hall laughing and hollering like a bunch of nuts. Before this happened some of the ones who were in bad shape, started to swim in the fish pond and I have a number of pictures of this.

We had survival instruction and lectures and meetings showing us how to survive in difficult situations. On our life jacket there was a packet of green dye. When it was exposed to water, the green dye would spread over a large area and could be seen for miles from the air. This saved many lives. In order to practice with the life boat, we were taken out to sea in a large boat about 30 or 40 feet long. Each of us had a seat pack with the life boat in it and after we were out a few miles, they told us to throw the seat packet into the water. The boat went another 100 feet of so and they told us to jump in the water, swim to the seat pack, open it, inflate the life boat and get in it. We had all of our cloths on except for shoes. The waves were about 5 feet high and quite rough. I dove into the water and swam to the seat pack, opened it and was about to get in it when some guy must have thrown up and it was floating by me. I started to get sick and never did get into by life boat. I have pictures of this also. I don’t know how someone who could not swim would pass this test. Another test was in the swimming pool. They had us get into a parachute harness which was attached to the high diving board and told to jump off the board and we would come to a halt, sometime flipping over before coming to a stop. We would then unhook the leg straps and the chest strap and pull ourselves into a setting position. This was done so when you bailed out and was approaching the water, you raised your arms straight up and fell out of the harness and into the water and you were free of the parachute and would not get tangled up in the shrouds. All you had to do then was get to the seat pack and get into the life boat. This was really good to practice. It would be a bit scary going down in the parachute with out being attached to it.

There was a Hawaiian girl by the name of Millie who use to call us on the telephone and ask if someone would come and see her and bring some whiskey and for this she would do anything. I know some of the guy use to visit her. She had a heavy accent and was difficult to understand, but she got the message through o.k. I think she was part Japanese.

One morning I got a call from my roommate, Ensign Duncan Upshal and he asked me to bring him some clothing down to this flea bitten hotel. He told me someone stole his cloths. He was at a dumpy hotel at the end of the main street in Hilo. When I got there, I went to his room and he was sleeping on a table about 3 by 4 and in the bed was Millie the Hawaiian girl. I guess he woke up and decided he didn’t like what he was sleeping with. I know that my roommate could not hold his drinking which was often. I wonder where he is today.

We were standing around the field, when we were notified that Lt Edward Bruffey was flying above the field and could not get his landing gear down. He would put the plane in a power dive and put the landing gear lever down when he would pull out of the dive really fast, but that didn’t work. He tried everything, but nothing seemed to work. The squadron commander told him he had the options of landing the plane, or bailing out. He decided to land the plane and flew the plane until it was almost out of gas. He brought the plane in so it would land beside the runways on the grass and this would cause less friction and less chance of fire. The best way to land a plane when you could not get the landing gear down was when you forgot and did not know they were still up. His approach was perfect and nose high and going as slow as he could. When he touched the ground and before he came to a stop, he was out of the cockpit and standing on the wing ready to jump off if there was trouble, but there was no trouble and he lucked out. Lt Bruffey was at Barin Field, Pensacola when I was going through the final stage. Our whole group flying in the gunnery stage got a down and I had to go before the Captains board to see if they would not wash us out. Lt Bruffey was on the board and they voted to give us more time, except as I said before, they washed one of us out. We all had to pass 2 check rides in order to continue, and lucky for me that I passed both of them and pretty good marks. I never said anything to Lt. Bruffey, but my navy jacket has the paper work with his name on it. Sorry to say, Lt Bruffey was killed just after the war in a jet crash. I don’t know the details.

Ensign Louis Harmon from Ypsilanti, Michigan had things happen to him. The first one was on take off from Hilo Air Station, his engine cut out and he did what you were supposed to do. He kept going straight ahead and landed in one of the Hawaiians gardens grown by one of the people who lived there. He almost destroyed the garden. He managed to get out safely, but the owner of the garden tried to sue the Navy. I don’t know how that turned out. The second thing that happened to Ensign Harmon was when his flight was coming back to the base. He was having trouble with his engine. Lt. Com. Spencer D. Wright was leading the flight like the one I was on. Harmon kept calling the skipper, telling him his plane was losing power. He kept calling the skipper and telling him this, when the skipper told him to get the hell out of the ship and he did. He was picked up later by a flying boat and was o.k. Harmon lived a charmed life. Harmon was from the zoot suit time in Detroit and he had his uniform Zoot suited. He pegged his pants and lengthened his coat and got a long chain like the Detroit Zoot suitors. Ensign Still took pictures of him and I have those today. Ensign Bjert our artist drew a sketch of him and I have a picture of that.

On the 12th of June, our flight went up for a night navigation flight and as soon as we got into the air, and joined up, we noticed that there was a lot of haze and the visibility was very poor. We canceled the flight and returned to the field and landed o.k., except for one of the pilots named Ensign Jack Theys. His problem was he forgot to put his landing gear down, and what a surprise when the propeller started to chew holes in the runway. When this happened, the plane would have to have an engine change. The props were made in two pieces and welded together so they would not be too heavy. Again, nothing was said to the pilot, but he got the business from us.

The VF squadron who flew the F6F Hellcats sent a flight up for some kind of exercise and there was a midair collision. Both planes went into the water. The navy sent out a search party and all they could find was a parachute lying in the water. The chest strap of the parachute was hooked together and one of the leg straps was unhooked and the other one was not. They thought that the pilot landed in the water o.k. and was unhooking his parachute when something must have gotten to him, and maybe had a meal. No proof of course, but 2 more pilots were gone. The cause of crash was pilot error. That made 3 pilots from the VF fighter squadron that we knew of that have been killed in Hawaii. How many before that in the states were not known.

When we were in the states, we were flying a 7 day schedule, and as soon as we got to Hawaii, they put us on 4 days of flying and 2 days off. We were happy about that. I would have my flying in the morning of 2 or 3 flights and the rest of the afternoon off, or flying in their afternoon and the morning off. We spent most of the free time at the pool, or the golf course. The food at Hilo was outstanding. There were a number of cattle ranges at Hilo and at dinner we could order steak any time we wanted. Sometimes they would have lamb and I would skip that and go to a little shack on the base and get a hamburger and pineapple juice. There was always some kind of fruit on the table. The steaks were as big as the plate. Every day we would go on a flight firing rockets or dropping bombs or gunnery practice. After one flight we would return and park our planes so they could refuel, and reload the armament. We would wait around while they did this and go up for and other flight. Sometimes we would have 2 flights of about 2 hours or sometimes 3 flights. This could be stressful as we flew in close formation all the time and did everything in an orderly manner. There was no time to relax and you had to really pay attention.

I should have mentioned that at Oceana we got the brand new redesigned F4U-4 Corsair. They increased the horse power and added a 4 bladed propeller. They redesigned the canopy to be almost like a bubble similar to some of the army planes. They also added a floor board under the seat and that made it more comfortable on a long flight. You could take your feet off the rudder controls and lay your feet flat on the floor board. When setting in the plane, it felt almost like you were lying down. My first flight in the new corsair was April 25, 1945 at NAS Oceans, Va. We had to fly the new corsair at a slow speed for a number of hours to break in the engine and from then on we flew the F4U-4 corsair most of the time. Today the F4U-4 is considered the finest plane of all. We still flew the older models from time to time and that was O.K., just a different cockpit arrangement. The new plane had a different look from the front because they added a scoop under the engine, which I thought made it look really good. Going to the new corsair from the older one was like going from a Chevrolet to a Cadillac.

Our air group decided to send up a flight of torpedo planes in an unknown area and then have a squadron of our corsairs try to find them and attack like in combat. They would be directed by radar. Again, this was a dangerous operation. When our group located them, they would attack in formation, and make gunnery runs on the torpedo planes. Lt. Shoemaker was leading the flight and one of the other pilots was Lt. JG. Robert Allen. As they were attacking the torpedo planes, Lt.J. G. Allen was too aggressive and crashed his plane into one of the torpedo planes. After the collision, both planes fell into the water and disappeared. I talked to Lt. Shoemaker a few years ago and he said he was screaming for the pilots and crew to bail out, but this did not happen. Lt. J.G. Allen’s wife was pregnant at the time and Shoemaker told me he watched Allen’s son grow up and become a famous sailboat racer and skipper of a famous sailboat. This was 4 more gone from our air group and the cause, ‘PILOT ERROR’.

The only thing I can think have that happened to the Helldiver squadron was when the canopy came off one of the planes, hitting the pilot in the eye as it went by. His entire face turned black, but he was not injured other than that and he made his was back to the base o.k.

On the 5th of July, our entire air group which included the fighter squadron, the torpedo squadron, the dive bomber squadron and our squadron and the fighter bomber squadron flew to Pearl Harbor 200 miles from Hilo to attack and bomb an area near a mountain range on the north side of Pearl Harbor, on the island of Oahu. The total number of planes of this flight was about 100. As we traveled the 200 miles to Oahu, our air group had to “S” turn back and forth under the rest of the planes because they were going a lot slower then we were, so it took quite a while to get there at that slow speed. When we got over the area we were to bomb, we had to take turns diving into the target. It had to be coordinated, or you might have a mid air collisions. We made a number of passes at the target. The mountain ranges were covered with a layer of clouds and we had to pull up very steep in order to miss the mountains and go through the clouds. We dropped the bombs first and fired the rockets on other passes. I can’t believe there was not a mid air collision. Our gas was getting low, so we flew to the NAS Station Barbers Point, which was very close to Ford Island and Pearl Harbor. When we got there, we had to take turns to be cleared to land because of so many planes. One of our planes dropped a havr 5 inch rocket in the middle of the runway. It took quite a while to get some one to pick the rocket up from the runway as it could have been a live round. We stayed at Barbers Point over night and the next morning we flew back to Hilo. My total time for that mission was 5.5 hours.

Back to NAS Oceana in May of 1945 when Jake Apelbaum was trying to make his landings on the USS Charger. He was coming into the grove, but not doing a very good job of it when the LSO gave him the signal to go around, or a wave off, he added throttle to go around when his engine cut out and the plane flipped over on its back and went into the water upside down As the plane was sinking he had trouble releasing the catch of his seat belt. He finally got the right release and came floating to the surface. He was so scared, he couldn’t figure out what to do when the plane was sinking. The destroyer that was behind the carrier picked him up and when he was feeling better, they transferred him to the carrier by the way of a seat that would travel over to the other ship on a cable. In token of the rescue by the destroyer, the carrier sent ice cream over to the ship for rescuing him. I guess that was a custom.

We were all making night carrier landings on the USS Charger at that time, but because Jake’s roommate was killed and Jake took his body to Ensign Berry’s home, he missed qualifying for night carrier landings. Because of this and while at Hilo, the skipper told him he was to go to Pearl Harbor to make his 2 night landings on the USS Saratoga which was there for training pilots. This was July 1945 when he flew to Pearl Harbor and landed on the USS Saratoga. When it turned dark, he took of to make his night landings. He made one landing, when the carrier told him to go to an altitude and orbit as some marine flyers were coming in to qualify. Jake told me this recently, while we were having lunch. While he was up waiting to be cleared to make his last landing, 3 marines were killed trying to qualify. They were never trained as good as navy pilots. After everything was cleared, they let him finish his 2nd landing. He told me he was shaking so bad, he didn’t know how he makes his landings. The next day, he took off and went back to Hilo. I have heard navy pilots talking on TV about their night missions in Vietnam and the only thing they were thinking about was the night landing on the carrier when they got back. Because of the trouble Jake had, the flight surgeon who was Jewish, told him that Jewish people did not make good pilots and offered to have him transferred back to the states to be an instructor, but Jake would have nothing to do with that. He wanted to stay with the squadron.

What happened to me next was as close to being killed as you can get. They asked me to take a plane that had been repaired up to check it out. I went out about 5 miles from the island and flew the plane all over the place to see if every thing was o.k. and it seemed to be. I had done this before. The plane was an older model, an F4U-1D. All of a sudden the seat fell off the back part of the plane and fell to the bottom of the fuselage. The older planes had no floor board and were empty space below the bottom of the seat all the way to the bottom of the fuselage. I was pined in the bottom and could not move. My head was lower than the sill or the bottom of the canopy. I couldn’t see out at all. My feet were higher than my bottom and I had to reach way up to get to the top of the control stick. If you can’t see the horizon, you have to fly by instruments and because I was wedged in, I could not use the rudders. I make sure that my speed was constant and with the help of the artificial horizon instrument, I was able to keep the plane flying level, but could not see to get back to the base. If I stalled out, that would have been the end of me. I knew the direction the field was and headed that way. As I was going back, I let the nose of the plane drop about 30 degrees or more and I could get a fix on the field. I kept doing this and losing altitude until I got back to the field and when I was about 100 feet off the runway and could not drop the nose anymore, I let the plane go down blind and finally it hit the runway and kept going until it ran off the runway and stopped. One of the field hands came out and pulled me out of the cockpit. If I had it to do over, I would have stayed in the plane and had them take a picture of this. I don’t believe this ever happened to another pilot. This would be one of a kind for a write up in the accident reports, which was done all the time to let other pilots to learn from the accidents and mistakes. I didn’t say anything to anyone except my roommate. Someone should have gotten their ass chewed out because of poor repair job. I know they had the seat off for repair and forgot to hook it back on with the bolts. I know I passed my instrument check doing this. I believe this happened in July 1945.

Jack Irwin was coming in for a landing when prop wash from the plane in front of him caused him to lose control and he ran off the runway and plowed through 5 parked airplanes. We called him an ace after that.

One of the pilots, I don’t remember who, was coming in for a landing not having fired his rockets. The air station did not like you coming back with armament. They ordered the pilot to fly out to sea and fire his rockets. He had been making his approach to a landing when they told him to do this. When he was out far enough, he fired his rockets, but he had forgotten to retract his flaps. When you fire rockets the force backward is the same force foreword and so he blew his flats off the plane. I guess he was really surprised. He returned to the base and landed without flaps, which was no big deal. You just had to come in a bit faster.

We flew around the island a lot and it was the most beautiful sight you could see. There were cliffs all around the island and there was no beach at the base of the mountains. There was lava every where. There were a lot of canyons, that would go back in land for a lot of distance and trees grew out of the side of the cliff parallel to the ground. The entire island was thick with trees and underbrush. I was told that planes that went down in those areas were never found. The island did not have snakes because of the mongoose there. There were boars there and some of the guys would go up the mountain hunting for them. They would put their backs next to a tree for protection. My skipper was quite a hunter and he loved to hunt the boars. First you had to get a permit to hunt them. The rest of the pilots would be setting around, or playing volley ball, cards, or just plane drinking.

We were on a high altitude flight, at about 30,000 feet when Lt. J.G. Brown radioed us and said he was losing his oxygen and he instantly turned his plane upside down trying to get to the altitude where there was oxygen. If you held you breath you could get to 15,000 feet pretty fast. If you didn’t find out your oxygen was low, you could be dead in about 30 seconds or less. There is no way you can tell that you are without oxygen except to look at the oxygen gage on the oxygen tank, or look at your finger nails and they should be pink looking. If they are white, you are in trouble. You could also feel the coolness of the oxygen flow inside your oxygen mask. Most of the time, we were flying at 25,000 feet or higher.

Our entire dive bombing flights were from 25,000 feet altitude. Another accident that happened was when my roommate Ensign Opshal was coming in for a landing and the prop wash from the plane in front of him caused his plane to start spinning and his left wing tip hit the runway and he started to cart wheel down the runway. The engine came off and went sliding to the end of the field and after a few flips the plane came to a stop. It wasn’t long before the rescue squad arrived at the crash and they pulled him from the plane and put him on a stretcher. He didn’t like that and got off the stretcher and started to leave and the medical guy’s grabbed him and through him back on the stretcher. In case of shock, they want to take you to the hospital for an examination. He wasn’t even scratched and was flying the next day. I have pictures of his plane with one of the wings twisted and other damage.

In the evening a bunch of us would be setting around someone’s room and we would be asking the pilots who had previous combat to tell us some of the stories and their experiences. Lt. J.G. Donnelly, of New York, was in a dog fight with a Jap Zero and fought him for quit a while and couldn’t turn his plane enough to get his sights on him and in the meantime another Zero fired at him and shot his canopy off and one bullet grazed his forehead. He has the scar to proof it. He was credited with shooting down 3 Japanese planes. I guess that’s why he always had a drink in his hand. He was awarded the DFC and Air Medal. Lt. J.G. Foster Looney was awarded the Navy Cross for helping to sink a Japanese carrier. He was in the famous VB-2 dive bombing squadron. He told me he was just along with the flight and did not know if his bomb hit the carrier or not. Our skipper was awarded the Navy Cross for shooting down 3 Jap flying boats and bombing installations. He was on the USS Wasp that was sunk at the same period. He jumped overboard and with the oil slick and being in the water for a long time before he was picked up, he almost did not make it. While on board the ship that picked him up, he wrote a letter to his wife explaining the sinking of the USS Wasp and reading it could bring tears to your eyes. I think it should be published, it is that good. I have copies of the letter. This was during the battle of Guadalcanal, August 15, 1942. When he was wearing his dress uniforms, he would be wearing the Navy Cross ribbon. I have photographs of him being awarded the Navy Cross.

It was about this time that they gave us our squadron patches and the decals of the patch. The Decals were about 6 inches wide and the patches were about 5 inches wide. Ensign Bjerk was the designer of the patch and I think it is the best design in the U.S. Navy. It is recorded in the archives in Washington. I have a poster of examples of Navy patches and our patch is on this poster. Ensign Bjerk made a few drawings and I wish I had one of them. When the weather was bad and the ceiling was low, they made us go up, one at a time to practice dropping a message on a simulated carrier. We would put our wheels and flats down and fly over the simulated carrier, put the plane in a bank and throw a heavy object out the side of cockpit and come in for a landing and someone else was ready to take his turn. It was a lot of fun. I was standing beside the runway and the skipper was beside me when Ensign Yanoshik was taking off and without leaving the runway, pulled his landing gear up. I can hear the skipper saying “GOD”. With the plane going down the runway before lift off, there was 3 inches of clearance from the tip of the propeller and the runway. I guess Yanoshik was showing off.

The Corsair was the best plane in the service to fly. When you got in the cockpit and started the engine, you could feel the power the engine that the 13-foot prop gave off. When you were flying, you had instant movement or 1 to 1 when you added throttle. I know in jet flying this was not true. In a jet there was a lag in your speed when you added throttle. That’s why when a jet landed on a carrier you had to have full power at touch down and when the plane caught the wires, then you pulled the throttle back. When you landed the corsair and had to go around, you added throttle and it had instant thrust. In the reverse, when you took power off the corsair, you slowed down instantly, making it easy to stay in formation flying. It was difficult to think a 2000 H.P. engine could fly a 7 ton airplane. You could fly the plane as slow as 90 knots which is almost 100 miles per hour and be very stable doing this. The wide landing gear was a plus and in fact the plane was perfect in every way. The experts called the corsair the Ensign eliminator, or the hog nose and the Japanese called it the whistling death. The wing was constructed in one piece and the fuselage was added to the wing. There was no way the wing could be separated form the plane or break apart.

The squadron picked 4 of us to go to Pearl Harbor and fly new planes to Hilo. We flew to Pearl Harbor in a C-47 twin engine plane and landed at Barbers Point NAS Station, and stayed over night. In the morning we were to fly the planes back to Hilo. We had time to spare and went into Honolulu to have some fun. The next morning we went over to Ford Island to look around. There was a new designed corsair parked with a marine standing in front of the plane with a rifle. As soon as we walked up to the plane, the marine said get the fuck out of there. This was one of the new 3000 H.P.Corsairs with 4 banks of 7 cylinders that was just produced. There were only 15 of these built and after the war a few of these were used in the national air races in Cleveland, Ohio. There is one of there planes in the museum at Phoenix, Arizona. After that, we went to the field at Barbers Point and got our 4 brand new F4U-4 corsairs and took off for Hilo. We climbed up to 15,000 feet, just under the oxygen limit and from then on we put the planes in a slight nose down descend and flew to Hilo at about 350 knots all the way. As we were flying, I noticed a hydraulic leak coming from the side of the wing where the landing gear was retracted. This was a typical spot for a hydraulic leak on new planes. This would be the 3rd time this happened to me. I knew by the time we got to Hilo I would not have any hydraulic pressure. There was 2 ways to get the landing gear down. The first was a hand crank inside of the cockpit and I knew that it would take a longtime and many cranks to get the landing gear down. I was not ready for this. The other way was a CO-2 bottle and when you put the landing gear lever in the down position and turned the handle of the C.O. 2 container, the landing gear would come down in a hurry and this was good only once. Just as we were cleared for landing, I used this method. No way was I going to use the crank method.

The Navy told us we were going to evade Japan, and our training changed. No longer would we be doing dive bombing as such, and no longer would we practice rockets as we had been doing. Instead of bombing and rockets from a steep angle, we would be doing skip bombing and rockets from a slight angle and at low altitude. The Navy put up large banners stretched across a beach and close to the water. The banner was about 50 feet high and about 100 feet across and it was quite large. We would break off form our flight, one at a time from about 5000 feet and dive straight down and level off at just above the water and head for the banner at the same level. When we got with in a couple of hundred feet from the banner, we would release the bomb and pull straight up with a slight turn and then we could see where the bomb hit. It was very easy to hit the target. We would do this over and over and this was more fun than any of the other types of bombing because you could tell the speed of your plane easier. And because of this change, the Navy changed the VF fighter squadron form flying hellcats to flying corsairs. The VF squadron always thought the hellcat was better than the corsair, but they changed their minds not long after the switch. We saw those chasing tails at night and other stupid things. If you look into the records you will see that the VF Squadron flew both the hellcats and corsairs.

On the 25th of July, we had two flights of field carrier landing practice at night. I don’t know why as we were not going to make any landing on a carrier at night.

We were notified that our entire air group would be flying to Pearl Harbor and go aboard the USS Antietam for practice as an air group simulating going into combat. The USS Antietam had just been commissioned and was ready to go into combat. We were going to have flights as if we were going into combat. When we started to land on the carrier, we had to take turns and to land 100 planes would take quite a while. It took a long time from Hilo to the carrier 200 miles distance. The flight I was flying in was at the very top of all of the planes and the furthest back. My leader started a cross over and went to close to the planes in front of us and I caught prop wash and it flipped me out of position and I started to lose altitude and every time I lost a few feet, I would hit the lower planes prop wash again and this continued until I was lower than any of the planes. I turned to get away from the planes and gradually got back to my flight and rejoined up. No one noticed what happened and nothing was said. Prop wash could cause a lot of trouble.

When we got close to the carrier, they would clear each flight to come in for their landings. To land 100 planes would take some time and I can’t think of very many wave offs, so we did pretty good. We would spend 7 days on the carrier and each squadron would go on flights of there own. They assigned us quarters and the higher ranks got the best rooms. I was assigned a bunk in the forward part of the ship called the facile bunk room. Again, that is where the lights never went out and there was always a card game going on. You could never get any sleep at any time. The first thing you heard early in the morning was the planes being catapulted and that make a heck of a noise. The carrier would operate all day long. The carrier would do this to practice the things they had to do under flight operations, almost more than the air group needed practice.

We would fly sometimes 2 flights everyday and in the 7 days I made 6 carrier landings. One of the flights I went on was a fighter directory assignment where the ACI department would direct you by radar to the spot they wanted you to go. In this case, they sent a flight of planes out in an undisclosed area, and they sent another flight to intercept them as if you were protecting the carrier. This could be dangerous when one flight started to attack the other group. We make so many turns, it would be really easy to get lost and not know where the carrier was. If the planes turned one way and I another, I would still be out there. They gave us a card with letters arranged in a circle with the center supposed to be the carrier. The carrier would send out signals in Morse code and we would pick the letters up on the radio this way you could find the carrier. This came out late war. Each day you would get a different card with the letters changed. This would be so the Japanese could no find out the system. Some of the early pilots would have loved to have this method as a lot of pilot lost their way and could not find their carrier. I heard that entire flights were lost.

I can’t believe we did not have some kind of accident in the seven days, but we were lucky. The one thing that happened was Ensign James Stills plane caught on fire. I was in the island of the carrier and watched him come in for the landing with smoke trailing back of his plane, but he made it o.k. There was always some sailor taking picture form the island with a large camera and he could take a picture every time he pulled the trigger. They gave Ensign Still a picture of his plane coming in on fire. We returned to Hilo on the 6th of July safely. We continued to fly our 2 or 3 flights a day and on the 15th of August we were told that the Japanese were accepting surrender and the place went wild. Some of the guys were pissed off as they wanted to get to combat and make a name for themselves. Most of the guys were happy as hell that the war was over and wanted to get home. My skipper was upset because he wanted to shoot down a couple more planes and become an ace.

That night we had a party to end all parties. The older guys rounded up a lot of 5th of whiskey and other drinks. They got a waste basket and filled it with bottles of booze and put a pillow in front of the basket. They would fill an old fashion glass full and each pilot would put there knees down on the pillow, make a toast and drink the glass full of whiskey in on gulp. If you wouldn’t do this, they would grab you, force you on the pillow and make you drink it. After a while, they wouldn’t have to force any one. Soon everyone was wasted, including me. Lt. J.G. Daughtry took me to his room, filled a tall glass of whiskey full and I drank it straight down

. A very dumb thing to do, but I was not in a condition to know any better. The last I knew, I was walking down the hall and I passed out standing up and didn’t wake up till the morning. I had thrown up all over the bed and I guess that was a good thing. I remember hitting each side of the walls and was completely blind. My friends told me they took all my clothes off and through me in a cold shower. One of the things I remembered was Lt. Maurice Rogers ‘BUCK ROGERS’, was on the floor and trying to get up on the bed and he was one of the drinkers of the squadron. The next day I lay by the pool and it was sometime before I could navigate. I was not the only one trying to recover.

I flew 12 more flights before the Japanese signed the surrender on the 15th of September, but we still kept on flying. While we were waiting around, the squadron decided to see if they could break the endurance record of a single engine airplane that the marines had set. The squadron picked Lt.J.G Raburn Schneidburg to set the record. They put 3 belly tanks on the plane. The main tank would hold 240 gallons of gas. He took off at 3 in the morning with a full supply of beer. He would fly around the island of Hawaii, staying as close to the shore as possible. Every time we saw the plane go by, you could almost count the revolutions of the prop. I believe he was flying at 1300 hundred R.P.M. and he had the gas mixture turned back as far as was safe. He came down at 5 o’clock in the after noon and they had to help him out of the cockpit and as far as I know, he set the record for that type of plane. 15 hours was a long time to stay up. It would be interesting to find out if this is recorded any where, but I witnessed the event. Finally they told 8 of the oldest and married pilots that they could go home. We had a small party for them and took pictures of the 8. They were loaded on a C-47 for the trip to Pearl Harbor and that started the end of our squadron after training together for 10 months, which is longer, I think, than any other squadron stayed together.

While at Hilo, I flew 13.4 hours in June, 49.2 hours in July, 20.4 hours in August, 16.8 hours in September, and 4.3 hours in October. On Oct 3rd after coming down from a flight and still at the airplane when a friend came out and told me that I was going to be the next one to go home along with Ensign Klein, and Ensign Wise. On Oct 8th, we boarded a C46 for the flight to Pearl Harbor. Looking back, I can’t believe I would not be flying the corsair again. How could I give that up? What happened next would always make me wonder if I could have refused. The reason I accepted was I thought this was also going to happen to the rest of the pilots in the squadron.

## CHAPTER NINETEEN: Homeward Bound on the Magic Carpet

We arrived at Pearl Harbor and they immediately gave us quarters on a base at the very highest point in Pearl Harbor. You could see Ford Island and the whole area where the Japanese bombed. There was not a birth vacant in the whole area. Ships were coming back from over seas loaded with soldiers and sailors coming back from the war. There were so many veterans waiting for a ship that it would be a long time before we would be assigned a ship. Our names were put on a list. Ships were going out to the war area to bring back the sailors and soldiers and this was called the ‘MAGIC CARPET’. It was a sight to behold.

I don’t remember how long we waited, but it was a long time. We got a bright idea to go down to the docks and go aboard some of the ships and see if they could put our names on there list to go home. We went down to Ford Island and started to go aboard the ships, one after another. We would go aboard to the Captains quarters where there was a marine with a rifle standing guard in front of the Captains office. We would ask permission to see the Captain and they always let us see him and we would ask if he had any room for 3 guys wanting to go home. After going aboard a number of ships, we came to the USS Hornet and got permission to see the Captain and asked him the same question. To our surprise he said we sure could and he would have the papers make out. I think this cut our waiting time down by a long ways.

I don’t remember the date, but it must have been at least Oct. 15th. In the mean time out air group was notified that they were going to get the USS Bunker Hill. This was sometime after the war had ended and I could not figure out why this was happening. Maybe they thought it was a good way to get the pilots back to the United States. They went aboard the carrier while I and my 2 buddies were waiting on the hill at Pearl Harbor. If I had known this was going to happen, I would have tried to stay with the air group.

As soon as the air group went aboard the USS Bunker Hill, they started flying missions, which was stupid. Jake Apelbaum told me he didn’t know why they had to fly at this time, when all they were going to do was go home. I saw one of the pilots later on at Ford Island and he told me they had an accident in which Ensign Parker was killed. On this flight, he flew on Lt.J.G Daughtey wing, taking my place. As they were coming into the area to break off for their interval for the landing, Ensign Parker pulled over to get in the right echelon prior to breaking off and he tried to be to hot doggish and pulled up into Lt.J.G. Daughter’s prop which cut his tail off. He turned upside down and went into the water and promptly disappeared. Tex also went into the water, but escaped with a damaged arm. He was picked up and taken back to the carrier. This was the last flight before the carrier was to head home. Only one more landing and Ensign Parker would have been safe to go home.

We finally went aboard the USS Hornet ready to go home. The ship was loaded with veterans from all the combat areas. They gave us a cot on the hanger deck. The hanger deck was cots from one end to the other. As the ship was pulling out of the dock, the full United States band was there playing songs. Just as we were leaving the dock, the band was playing Aloha It was so beautiful, it would bring tears to your eyes After that they started to play, San Francisco, here we come and we were on our way.

The trip would take 5 days and on Sunday, we had to listen to all the church services. The trip home was quite boring, as there were so many veterans on the ship, you could hardly move. The band must have been busy for all of the ships leaving to bring the veterans home. It was sad to be leaving Hawaii after 5 months of being at that beautiful place. As you were leaving, you could see Diamond Head Point to the right of Pearl Harbor. Think how happy the soldiers and sailors were finally going home. I know they had notified there parents or relatives that they were coming home. Tyrone Power, a Marine aviator was suppose to be aboard, but I never saw him. There was too many aboard.

After 5 days and as we were nearing San Francisco Harbor, A large ship with a large all girl band followed us all the way playing beautiful music. Also there was an airship that came down, almost touching the deck, and they were playing music. They followed us all the way into the harbor. Someone should have been taking pictures of this, as it was historic.

It was always exciting watching the docking of the ship. We docked at the Air Station, Alameda. When we docked, there were 3 other carriers docked next to us. The area on the dock was full of relatives who were screaming and making so much noise you could hardly hear. The women were crying and going crazy. The veterans were lined up full force along the railing, just waiting for the order to leave. They were all packed and eager to get off. They lowered the gang plank and gave the order that you could leave. As the veterans were leaving the ship, they gave the salute to the officer of the deck and the flag as fast as I have ever seen, and then running down the gang plank.

I know there is film of the historic USS Hornet docking and some still pictures. I had no one meeting me, but I was going to meet my brother-in-law, Fred Conners in San Francisco. He was in the Air force and stationed at Hamilton Field. My brother-in-law had only one eye. When he was a small boy, another kid shot him in the eye with an arrow causing him to lose sight in that eye. This did not stop him at all. He tried to enlist in all of the services, but they would not take him because of his eye problem. Finally, the Air Force drafted him and I know he was really proud of that. When I finally met him, I had to find a place to stay. The entire city was full of veterans and the city put cots in all of the stores and all you had to do was go into one of the stores and grab a cot.

We were downtown, near the St Francis Hotel and next to the Palace hotel and I said to Fred, lets try the Palace Hotel. I went up to the check in desk and said I would like a room. This I cannot believe as they gave me a room that I had to share with a Captain in the Navy. Maybe because I was an officer is the reason I got the room, but I was happy. We went out on the town that evening, but the bars and lounges were so crowded that you could not get waited on. It was some sight to see all of the sailors and soldiers in the streets. I reported to the Navy department to see about transportation to Great Lakes, Illinois, where I was to be discharged, but there was no hurry. All I had to do was get there. They put my name on a list and it looked like it would be a long time to get my travel orders. You had to wait your turn.

Because Fred was stationed at Hamilton Field, he told me why I don’t try to get you on a flight from Hamilton Field going east. That was o.k. with me and finally he succeeded in getting me a flight that was going to leave the next day. We had to leave right then and had no time to check out of the Palace hotel and get my luggage. Fred said he would take care of that and we went to Hamilton field which was not that far away. Then I got a ride to Mather field not far away where I would get a plane going east. I said goodbye to Fred and when I got to Mather field, I got checked into a room in one of the dorms. As soon as the Air Force flyers saw me, they grabbed me and said we were going into Sacramento to have a good time, which we did. They were pilots of B-29 flying fortresses. The next morning, I boarded a C-47 twin engine plane. I found out we were going to Kansas City, Kansas via New Mexico. I had no clothing and especially not a warm coat. There were no seats in the plane, just some items they were taking to Kansas City. I lie on the floor and put my head on some luggage. It was very cold at the altitude they were flying. The first stop was Albuquerque, New Mexico. When I got out of the plane, it felt like I was in a furnace it was so hot. Soon we were on our way to Kansas.

That was as far as the plane was going east. From there I took train to Great Lakes Naval Station, or boot camp. This is where my brother was sent for boot camp in 1941. I was there a couple of days and they gave me a physical. I don’t know why. If I failed, all they could do was kick me out. I think this is the time you can have an injury verified and get an allotment for the rest of your life. Just before I signed the final papers for discharge, they offered me a chance to stay in the Navy with an increase in rank to Lt.J.G. This is one of the major mistakes I ever made. Given a second chance, I would sign in a minute. The only thing left to do was get on a train and go home which I did. This was the end of a very exciting experience.

## CHAPTER TWENTY: After the War

The Becker Street gang after the war

Gerald Nichols was killed shooting a Jap down while flying off the USS Yorktown, He was awarded the Air Medal and I think for what he did he should have gotten the Navy Cross. January 1945. Ray Yelland flew B-24s and was shot down in the Kurial Islands and managed to survive after spending a week trapped in snow 5 or 6 feet high. He was sent home through the underground and through Russia and was discharged because, if he were taken as a captive, he would be tried as a spy. He was awarded the DFC and the Air Medal. Bill Hart flew C 46s over the hump in China and he survived o.k. Dick Asp was in the navy and got home safe. Robert Taylor did not go into the service. Campbell Spence was in the navy and shortly after he got home, he died of cancer. Skip Mills was a navigator and I don’t think he saw combat. Bob Thompson was sent to San Diego to join an Air Group, but before he had a chance to go into combat, he was killed night flying. He crashed into a mountain, south of San Diego. None of the Skaffs went into the service.

This is the end of story except for making correction Robert Ewen McGaffin Ensign U.S. Navy. This is the first draft and there will be changes and additions later on.

### A Footnote

The United States navy donated an F4U-1D to the National Air and Space Museum in September 1960. Vought delivered this Corsair, Bureau of Aeronautics serial number 50375, to the Navy on April 26, 1944. By October, pilots of VF-10 were flying it but in November, the airplane was transferred to VF-89 at Naval Air Station Atlantic City. It remained there as the squadron moved to Naval Air Station Oceana and NAS Norfolk. During February 1945, the Navy with drew the airplane from active service and transferred it to a pool of surplus aircraft stored at Quantico, Virginia. In 1980, NASM craftsmen restored the F4U-1D in the colors and markings of a Corsair named “Sun Setter,” a fighter assigned to Marine Fighter Squadron VMF-114 when that unit served aboard the USS Essex in July 1944. The plane is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum at Dulles Air Field, Washington This plane was flown by all the pilots in my Air Group 95 while we were stationed at NAS Oceana, Virginia in June of 1944. The number 50375 is listed in my log book. The pictures of this plane called the sun setter shows the plane with number 56 on the fuselage.

In order to become a navy pilot before the war, you must have had a college degree. In 1941 they changed the requirements to 2 years of college. Before 1942 all future pilots took their training at the N.A.S. Pensacola and they stayed there until they were designated a naval aviator. The training took about 12 months and consisted of 5 stages, beginning with bi-planes. The nest stage was flying on the water with float planes. Then the pilots went on to heavier planes and instrument training. After that, they flew heavy flying boats and finally on to airplanes they would fly in combat. This was all done at the N.A.S. Pensacola. There were two other places where cadets trained and graduated as pilot and these were at Miami and Jacksonville, but not too many trained there. Most of the cadets trained at Pensacola. By the end of 1942 there were about 6000 designed naval aviators. From 1942 till the end of the war the system changed by sending the cadets to different fields located all over the United States for each stage and finally to Pensacola or Corpus Christi, Texas, and from there to fields located I n Florida for advanged training in combat airplanes. I tried to tell the story of the training from 1942 to 1945 in order to become Navy Pilots. This type of training only lasted during the war years. In 1942 the requirements were changed to high school graduate and 18 years of age. When these cadets graduated, most of them were only 19 or 20 years of age and were the youngest in the history of Naval Aviation. I just turned 20 when I was designated a Naval Aviator. In the years to come the history of the training for navy pilots in ww11 will be lost. The history at one base will be known, but not the total sequence.

### A Note about Lt J.G Sid Cichy

When Cid returned home, he became a coach at a high school in Fargo, North Dakota. In the next 35 years as a coach he won at least 30 national titles and was enshrined in many coached hall of fame, including the national hall of fame. He passed away in January 2006. Sid was also the teacher of Roger Maris and taught him to play football and baseball.

Bill Hart flew C 46s over the hump in China and he survived o.k. Dick Asp was in the navy and got home safe. Robert Taylor did not go into the service. Campbell Spence was in the navy and shortly after he got home, he died of cancer. Skip Mills was a navigator and I don’t think he saw combat. Bob Thompson was sent to San Diego to join an Air Group, but before he had a chance to go into combat, he was killed night flying. He crashed into a mountain, south of San Diego. None of the Skaffs went into the service.

This is the end of story except for making correction Robert Ewen McGaffin Ensign U.S. Navy. This is the first draft and there will be changes and additions later on.

### A Footnote

The United States navy donated an F4U-1D to the National Air and Space Museum in September 1960. Vought delivered this Corsair, Bureau of Aeronautics serial number 50375, to the Navy on April 26, 1944. By October, pilots of VF-10 were flying it but in November, the airplane was transferred to VF-89 at Naval Air Station Atlantic City. It remained there as the squadron moved to Naval Air Station Oceana and NAS Norfolk. During February 1945, the Navy with drew the airplane from active service and transferred it to a pool of surplus aircraft stored at Quantico, Virginia. In 1980, NASM craftsmen restored the F4U-1D in the colors and markings of a Corsair named “Sun Setter,” a fighter assigned to Marine Fighter Squadron VMF-114 when that unit served aboard the USS Essex in July 1944. The plane is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum at Dulles Air Field, Washington This plane was flown by all the pilots in my Air Group 95 while we were stationed at NAS Oceana, Virginia in June of 1944. The number 50375 is listed in my log book. The pictures of this plane called the sun setter shows the plane with number 56 on the fuselage.

In order to become a navy pilot before the war, you must have had a college degree. In 1941 they changed the requirements to 2 years of college. Before 1942 all future pilots took their training at the N.A.S. Pensacola and they stayed there until they were designated a naval aviator. The training took about 12 months and consisted of 5 stages, beginning with bi-planes. The nest stage was flying on the water with float planes. Then the pilots went on to heavier planes and instrument training. After that, they flew heavy flying boats and finally on to airplanes they would fly in combat. This was all done at the N.A.S. Pensacola. There were two other places where cadets trained and graduated as pilot and these were at Miami and Jacksonville, but not too many trained there. Most of the cadets trained at Pensacola. By the end of 1942 there were about 6000 designed naval aviators. From 1942 till the end of the war the system changed by sending the cadets to different fields located all over the United States for each stage and finally to Pensacola or Corpus Christi, Texas, and from there to fields located I n Florida for advanged training in combat airplanes. I tried to tell the story of the training from 1942 to 1945 in order to become Navy Pilots. This type of training only lasted during the war years. In 1942 the requirements were changed to high school graduate and 18 years of age. When these cadets graduated, most of them were only 19 or 20 years of age and were the youngest in the history of Naval Aviation. I just turned 20 when I was designated a Naval Aviator. In the years to come the history of the training for navy pilots in ww11 will be lost. The history at one base will be known, but not the total sequence.

### A Note about Lt J.G Sid Cichy

When Cid returned home, he became a coach at a high school in Fargo, North Dakota. In the next 35 years as a coach he won at least 30 national titles and was enshrined in many coached hall of fame, including the national hall of fame. He passed away in January 2006. Sid was also the teacher of Roger Maris and taught him to play football and baseball.

180 degrees and go back to the field without engine power as you would stall out and spin into the ground. This pilot decided to try to turn back to the field. There is always a temptation to do this, trying to survive. Just as soon as he turned, the plane stalled out and spun into the ground. There wasn’t much left of him. I heard they picked part of his head out of the instrument panel. It takes nerve to stay going straight ahead. Even that would not do any good, unless the ground was flat and no buildings etc. As soon as the engine cuts out you must get the nose down in order to keep flying speed and we were trained in that in our early training. The instructor would pull the throttle back and if you didn’t get the nose down really quick, he would rape you knuckles with something.

I was flying on a navigation flight of about 3 hours with our squadron and was returning when the red light on my gas gage came on, which meant I had 50 gallons of gas left and had to switch to that reserve. Because I was flying in the eighth position, you would use more gas than the rest of the planes. You would be constantly moving the throttle back and forth to stay in position. The number 2 plane would hardly have to do this. I called the skipper and told him what was happening and he said “SO”. I didn’t know how far we were from the field and was a bit nervous. we were getting close to the field, flying at 800 feet and was starting to circle it when my engine cut out. There was a runway about 30 degrees to my left, so I dropped my landing gear and flaps as fast as I could and without using ailerons’, I used the rudder to inch my plane around to line up with the runway and was really to close. I was going down very steep, leveled the plane off and hit the runway o.k. Because I was so close, to the runway and after I touched down, I had to pump the brakes back forth and barely stopped in front of the fire truck, which was waiting for me. The skipper had called the base and told them of my troubles. If the engine had quit a few seconds before, I would have gone into the water and if it had been a couple of seconds later, I would have gone into the mountain. They checked the gas tank with a long stick and there was no gas left at all. I was pretty lucky. Looking back, it was the skipper’s fault, staying out too long with no margin of error. But, being young, I did not say anything about it, but should have.

It seemed like drinking was going on all the time. One day at noon, just before we were to have lunch, the whole squadron started to drink and it wasn’t long before everyone of us were smashed. Someone suggested we line up and count off, like they did in the army, We lined up in front of the fish pond and counted off as they did in the army and one of the senior officers marched us to the mess hall laughing and hollering like a bunch of nuts. Before this happened some of the ones who were in bad shape, started to swim in the fish pond and I have a number of pictures of this.

We had survival instruction and lectures and meetings showing us how to survive in difficult situations. On our life jacket there was a packet of green dye. When it was exposed to water, the green dye would spread over a large area and could be seen for miles from the air. This saved many lives. In order to practice with the life boat, we were taken out to sea in a large boat about 30 or 40 feet long. Each of us had a seat pack with the life boat in it and after we were out a few miles, they told us to throw the seat packet into the water. The boat went another 100 feet of so and they told us to jump in the water, swim to the seat pack, open it, inflate the life boat and get in it. We had all of our cloths on except for shoes. The waves were about 5 feet high and quite rough. I dove into the water and swam to the seat pack, opened it and was about to get in it when some guy must have thrown up and it was floating by me. I started to get sick and never did get into by life boat. I have pictures of this also. I don’t know how someone who could not swim would pass this test. Another test was in the swimming pool. They had us get into a parachute harness which was attached to the high diving board and told to jump off the board and we would come to a halt, sometime flipping over before coming to a stop. We would then unhook the leg straps and the chest strap and pull ourselves into a setting position. This was done so when you bailed out and was approaching the water, you raised your arms straight up and fell out of the harness and into the water and you were free of the parachute and would not get tangled up in the shrouds. All you had to do then was get to the seat pack and get into the life boat. This was really good to practice. It would be a bit scary going down in the parachute with out being attached to it.

There was a Hawaiian girl by the name of Millie who use to call us on the telephone and ask if someone would come and see her and bring some whiskey and for this she would do anything. I know some of the guy use to visit her. She had a heavy accent and was difficult to understand, but she got the message through o.k. I think she was part Japanese.

One morning I got a call from my roommate, Ensign Duncan Upshal and he asked me to bring him some clothing down to this flea bitten hotel. He told me someone stole his cloths. He was at a dumpy hotel at the end of the main street in Hilo. When I got there, I went to his room and he was sleeping on a table about 3 by 4 and in the bed was Millie the Hawaiian girl. I guess he woke up and decided he didn’t like what he was sleeping with. I know that my roommate could not hold his drinking which was often. I wonder where he is today.

We were standing around the field, when we were notified that Lt Edward Bruffey was flying above the field and could not get his landing gear down. He would put the plane in a power dive and put the landing gear lever down when he would pull out of the dive really fast, but that didn’t work. He tried everything, but nothing seemed to work. The squadron commander told him he had the options of landing the plane, or bailing out. He decided to land the plane and flew the plane until it was almost out of gas. He brought the plane in so it would land beside the runways on the grass and this would cause less friction and less chance of fire. The best way to land a plane when you could not get the landing gear down was when you forgot and did not know they were still up. His approach was perfect and nose high and going as slow as he could. When he touched the ground and before he came to a stop, he was out of the cockpit and standing on the wing ready to jump off if there was trouble, but there was no trouble and he lucked out. Lt Bruffey was at Barin Field, Pensacola when I was going through the final stage. Our whole group flying in the gunnery stage got a down and I had to go before the Captains board to see if they would not wash us out. Lt Bruffey was on the board and they voted to give us more time, except as I said before, they washed one of us out. We all had to pass 2 check rides in order to continue, and lucky for me that I passed both of them and pretty good marks. I never said anything to Lt. Bruffey, but my navy jacket has the paper work with his name on it. Sorry to say, Lt Bruffey was killed just after the war in a jet crash. I don’t know the details.

Ensign Louis Harmon from Ypsilanti, Michigan had things happen to him. The first one was on take off from Hilo Air Station, his engine cut out and he did what you were supposed to do. He kept going straight ahead and landed in one of the Hawaiians gardens grown by one of the people who lived there. He almost destroyed the garden. He managed to get out safely, but the owner of the garden tried to sue the Navy. I don’t know how that turned out. The second thing that happened to Ensign Harmon was when his flight was coming back to the base. He was having trouble with his engine. Lt. Com. Spencer D. Wright was leading the flight like the one I was on. Harmon kept calling the skipper, telling him his plane was losing power. He kept calling the skipper and telling him this, when the skipper told him to get the hell out of the ship and he did. He was picked up later by a flying boat and was o.k. Harmon lived a charmed life. Harmon was from the zoot suit time in Detroit and he had his uniform Zoot suited. He pegged his pants and lengthened his coat and got a long chain like the Detroit Zoot suitors. Ensign Still took pictures of him and I have those today. Ensign Bjert our artist drew a sketch of him and I have a picture of that.

On the 12th of June, our flight went up for a night navigation flight and as soon as we got into the air, and joined up, we noticed that there was a lot of haze and the visibility was very poor. We canceled the flight and returned to the field and landed o.k., except for one of the pilots named Ensign Jack Theys. His problem was he forgot to put his landing gear down, and what a surprise when the propeller started to chew holes in the runway. When this happened, the plane would have to have an engine change. The props were made in two pieces and welded together so they would not be too heavy. Again, nothing was said to the pilot, but he got the business from us.

The VF squadron who flew the F6F Hellcats sent a flight up for some kind of exercise and there was a midair collision. Both planes went into the water. The navy sent out a search party and all they could find was a parachute lying in the water. The chest strap of the parachute was hooked together and one of the leg straps was unhooked and the other one was not. They thought that the pilot landed in the water o.k. and was unhooking his parachute when something must have gotten to him, and maybe had a meal. No proof of course, but 2 more pilots were gone. The cause of crash was pilot error. That made 3 pilots from the VF fighter squadron that we knew of that have been killed in Hawaii. How many before that in the states were not known.

When we were in the states, we were flying a 7 day schedule, and as soon as we got to Hawaii, they put us on 4 days of flying and 2 days off. We were happy about that. I would have my flying in the morning of 2 or 3 flights and the rest of the afternoon off, or flying in their afternoon and the morning off. We spent most of the free time at the pool, or the golf course. The food at Hilo was outstanding. There were a number of cattle ranges at Hilo and at dinner we could order steak any time we wanted. Sometimes they would have lamb and I would skip that and go to a little shack on the base and get a hamburger and pineapple juice. There was always some kind of fruit on the table. The steaks were as big as the plate. Every day we would go on a flight firing rockets or dropping bombs or gunnery practice. After one flight we would return and park our planes so they could refuel, and reload the armament. We would wait around while they did this and go up for and other flight. Sometimes we would have 2 flights of about 2 hours or sometimes 3 flights. This could be stressful as we flew in close formation all the time and did everything in an orderly manner. There was no time to relax and you had to really pay attention.

I should have mentioned that at Oceana we got the brand new redesigned F4U-4 Corsair. They increased the horse power and added a 4 bladed propeller. They redesigned the canopy to be almost like a bubble similar to some of the army planes. They also added a floor board under the seat and that made it more comfortable on a long flight. You could take your feet off the rudder controls and lay your feet flat on the floor board. When setting in the plane, it felt almost like you were lying down. My first flight in the new corsair was April 25, 1945 at NAS Oceans, Va. We had to fly the new corsair at a slow speed for a number of hours to break in the engine and from then on we flew the F4U-4 corsair most of the time. Today the F4U-4 is considered the finest plane of all. We still flew the older models from time to time and that was O.K., just a different cockpit arrangement. The new plane had a different look from the front because they added a scoop under the engine, which I thought made it look really good. Going to the new corsair from the older one was like going from a Chevrolet to a Cadillac.

Our air group decided to send up a flight of torpedo planes in an unknown area and then have a squadron of our corsairs try to find them and attack like in combat. They would be directed by radar. Again, this was a dangerous operation. When our group located them, they would attack in formation, and make gunnery runs on the torpedo planes. Lt. Shoemaker was leading the flight and one of the other pilots was Lt. JG. Robert Allen. As they were attacking the torpedo planes, Lt.J. G. Allen was too aggressive and crashed his plane into one of the torpedo planes. After the collision, both planes fell into the water and disappeared. I talked to Lt. Shoemaker a few years ago and he said he was screaming for the pilots and crew to bail out, but this did not happen. Lt. J.G. Allen’s wife was pregnant at the time and Shoemaker told me he watched Allen’s son grow up and become a famous sailboat racer and skipper of a famous sailboat. This was 4 more gone from our air group and the cause, ‘PILOT ERROR’.

The only thing I can think have that happened to the Helldiver squadron was when the canopy came off one of the planes, hitting the pilot in the eye as it went by. His entire face turned black, but he was not injured other than that and he made his was back to the base o.k.

On the 5th of July, our entire air group which included the fighter squadron, the torpedo squadron, the dive bomber squadron and our squadron and the fighter bomber squadron flew to Pearl Harbor 200 miles from Hilo to attack and bomb an area near a mountain range on the north side of Pearl Harbor, on the island of Oahu. The total number of planes of this flight was about 100. As we traveled the 200 miles to Oahu, our air group had to “S” turn back and forth under the rest of the planes because they were going a lot slower then we were, so it took quite a while to get there at that slow speed. When we got over the area we were to bomb, we had to take turns diving into the target. It had to be coordinated, or you might have a mid air collisions. We made a number of passes at the target. The mountain ranges were covered with a layer of clouds and we had to pull up very steep in order to miss the mountains and go through the clouds. We dropped the bombs first and fired the rockets on other passes. I can’t believe there was not a mid air collision. Our gas was getting low, so we flew to the NAS Station Barbers Point, which was very close to Ford Island and Pearl Harbor. When we got there, we had to take turns to be cleared to land because of so many planes. One of our planes dropped a havr 5 inch rocket in the middle of the runway. It took quite a while to get some one to pick the rocket up from the runway as it could have been a live round. We stayed at Barbers Point over night and the next morning we flew back to Hilo. My total time for that mission was 5.5 hours.

Back to NAS Oceana in May of 1945 when Jake Apelbaum was trying to make his landings on the USS Charger. He was coming into the grove, but not doing a very good job of it when the LSO gave him the signal to go around, or a wave off, he added throttle to go around when his engine cut out and the plane flipped over on its back and went into the water upside down As the plane was sinking he had trouble releasing the catch of his seat belt. He finally got the right release and came floating to the surface. He was so scared, he couldn’t figure out what to do when the plane was sinking. The destroyer that was behind the carrier picked him up and when he was feeling better, they transferred him to the carrier by the way of a seat that would travel over to the other ship on a cable. In token of the rescue by the destroyer, the carrier sent ice cream over to the ship for rescuing him. I guess that was a custom.

We were all making night carrier landings on the USS Charger at that time, but because Jake’s roommate was killed and Jake took his body to Ensign Berry’s home, he missed qualifying for night carrier landings. Because of this and while at Hilo, the skipper told him he was to go to Pearl Harbor to make his 2 night landings on the USS Saratoga which was there for training pilots. This was July 1945 when he flew to Pearl Harbor and landed on the USS Saratoga. When it turned dark, he took of to make his night landings. He made one landing, when the carrier told him to go to an altitude and orbit as some marine flyers were coming in to qualify. Jake told me this recently, while we were having lunch. While he was up waiting to be cleared to make his last landing, 3 marines were killed trying to qualify. They were never trained as good as navy pilots. After everything was cleared, they let him finish his 2nd landing. He told me he was shaking so bad, he didn’t know how he makes his landings. The next day, he took off and went back to Hilo. I have heard navy pilots talking on TV about their night missions in Vietnam and the only thing they were thinking about was the night landing on the carrier when they got back. Because of the trouble Jake had, the flight surgeon who was Jewish, told him that Jewish people did not make good pilots and offered to have him transferred back to the states to be an instructor, but Jake would have nothing to do with that. He wanted to stay with the squadron.

What happened to me next was as close to being killed as you can get. They asked me to take a plane that had been repaired up to check it out. I went out about 5 miles from the island and flew the plane all over the place to see if every thing was o.k. and it seemed to be. I had done this before. The plane was an older model, an F4U-1D. All of a sudden the seat fell off the back part of the plane and fell to the bottom of the fuselage. The older planes had no floor board and were empty space below the bottom of the seat all the way to the bottom of the fuselage. I was pined in the bottom and could not move. My head was lower than the sill or the bottom of the canopy. I couldn’t see out at all. My feet were higher than my bottom and I had to reach way up to get to the top of the control stick. If you can’t see the horizon, you have to fly by instruments and because I was wedged in, I could not use the rudders. I make sure that my speed was constant and with the help of the artificial horizon instrument, I was able to keep the plane flying level, but could not see to get back to the base. If I stalled out, that would have been the end of me. I knew the direction the field was and headed that way. As I was going back, I let the nose of the plane drop about 30 degrees or more and I could get a fix on the field. I kept doing this and losing altitude until I got back to the field and when I was about 100 feet off the runway and could not drop the nose anymore, I let the plane go down blind and finally it hit the runway and kept going until it ran off the runway and stopped. One of the field hands came out and pulled me out of the cockpit. If I had it to do over, I would have stayed in the plane and had them take a picture of this. I don’t believe this ever happened to another pilot. This would be one of a kind for a write up in the accident reports, which was done all the time to let other pilots to learn from the accidents and mistakes. I didn’t say anything to anyone except my roommate. Someone should have gotten their ass chewed out because of poor repair job. I know they had the seat off for repair and forgot to hook it back on with the bolts. I know I passed my instrument check doing this. I believe this happened in July 1945.

Jack Irwin was coming in for a landing when prop wash from the plane in front of him caused him to lose control and he ran off the runway and plowed through 5 parked airplanes. We called him an ace after that.

One of the pilots, I don’t remember who, was coming in for a landing not having fired his rockets. The air station did not like you coming back with armament. They ordered the pilot to fly out to sea and fire his rockets. He had been making his approach to a landing when they told him to do this. When he was out far enough, he fired his rockets, but he had forgotten to retract his flaps. When you fire rockets the force backward is the same force foreword and so he blew his flats off the plane. I guess he was really surprised. He returned to the base and landed without flaps, which was no big deal. You just had to come in a bit faster.

We flew around the island a lot and it was the most beautiful sight you could see. There were cliffs all around the island and there was no beach at the base of the mountains. There was lava every where. There were a lot of canyons, that would go back in land for a lot of distance and trees grew out of the side of the cliff parallel to the ground. The entire island was thick with trees and underbrush. I was told that planes that went down in those areas were never found. The island did not have snakes because of the mongoose there. There were boars there and some of the guys would go up the mountain hunting for them. They would put their backs next to a tree for protection. My skipper was quite a hunter and he loved to hunt the boars. First you had to get a permit to hunt them. The rest of the pilots would be setting around, or playing volley ball, cards, or just plane drinking.

We were on a high altitude flight, at about 30,000 feet when Lt. J.G. Brown radioed us and said he was losing his oxygen and he instantly turned his plane upside down trying to get to the altitude where there was oxygen. If you held you breath you could get to 15,000 feet pretty fast. If you didn’t find out your oxygen was low, you could be dead in about 30 seconds or less. There is no way you can tell that you are without oxygen except to look at the oxygen gage on the oxygen tank, or look at your finger nails and they should be pink looking. If they are white, you are in trouble. You could also feel the coolness of the oxygen flow inside your oxygen mask. Most of the time, we were flying at 25,000 feet or higher.

Our entire dive bombing flights were from 25,000 feet altitude. Another accident that happened was when my roommate Ensign Opshal was coming in for a landing and the prop wash from the plane in front of him caused his plane to start spinning and his left wing tip hit the runway and he started to cart wheel down the runway. The engine came off and went sliding to the end of the field and after a few flips the plane came to a stop. It wasn’t long before the rescue squad arrived at the crash and they pulled him from the plane and put him on a stretcher. He didn’t like that and got off the stretcher and started to leave and the medical guy’s grabbed him and through him back on the stretcher. In case of shock, they want to take you to the hospital for an examination. He wasn’t even scratched and was flying the next day. I have pictures of his plane with one of the wings twisted and other damage.

In the evening a bunch of us would be setting around someone’s room and we would be asking the pilots who had previous combat to tell us some of the stories and their experiences. Lt. J.G. Donnelly, of New York, was in a dog fight with a Jap Zero and fought him for quit a while and couldn’t turn his plane enough to get his sights on him and in the meantime another Zero fired at him and shot his canopy off and one bullet grazed his forehead. He has the scar to proof it. He was credited with shooting down 3 Japanese planes. I guess that’s why he always had a drink in his hand. He was awarded the DFC and Air Medal. Lt. J.G. Foster Looney was awarded the Navy Cross for helping to sink a Japanese carrier. He was in the famous VB-2 dive bombing squadron. He told me he was just along with the flight and did not know if his bomb hit the carrier or not. Our skipper was awarded the Navy Cross for shooting down 3 Jap flying boats and bombing installations. He was on the USS Wasp that was sunk at the same period. He jumped overboard and with the oil slick and being in the water for a long time before he was picked up, he almost did not make it. While on board the ship that picked him up, he wrote a letter to his wife explaining the sinking of the USS Wasp and reading it could bring tears to your eyes. I think it should be published, it is that good. I have copies of the letter. This was during the battle of Guadalcanal, August 15, 1942. When he was wearing his dress uniforms, he would be wearing the Navy Cross ribbon. I have photographs of him being awarded the Navy Cross.

It was about this time that they gave us our squadron patches and the decals of the patch. The Decals were about 6 inches wide and the patches were about 5 inches wide. Ensign Bjerk was the designer of the patch and I think it is the best design in the U.S. Navy. It is recorded in the archives in Washington. I have a poster of examples of Navy patches and our patch is on this poster. Ensign Bjerk made a few drawings and I wish I had one of them. When the weather was bad and the ceiling was low, they made us go up, one at a time to practice dropping a message on a simulated carrier. We would put our wheels and flats down and fly over the simulated carrier, put the plane in a bank and throw a heavy object out the side of cockpit and come in for a landing and someone else was ready to take his turn. It was a lot of fun. I was standing beside the runway and the skipper was beside me when Ensign Yanoshik was taking off and without leaving the runway, pulled his landing gear up. I can hear the skipper saying “GOD”. With the plane going down the runway before lift off, there was 3 inches of clearance from the tip of the propeller and the runway. I guess Yanoshik was showing off.

The Corsair was the best plane in the service to fly. When you got in the cockpit and started the engine, you could feel the power the engine that the 13-foot prop gave off. When you were flying, you had instant movement or 1 to 1 when you added throttle. I know in jet flying this was not true. In a jet there was a lag in your speed when you added throttle. That’s why when a jet landed on a carrier you had to have full power at touch down and when the plane caught the wires, then you pulled the throttle back. When you landed the corsair and had to go around, you added throttle and it had instant thrust. In the reverse, when you took power off the corsair, you slowed down instantly, making it easy to stay in formation flying. It was difficult to think a 2000 H.P. engine could fly a 7 ton airplane. You could fly the plane as slow as 90 knots which is almost 100 miles per hour and be very stable doing this. The wide landing gear was a plus and in fact the plane was perfect in every way. The experts called the corsair the Ensign eliminator, or the hog nose and the Japanese called it the whistling death. The wing was constructed in one piece and the fuselage was added to the wing. There was no way the wing could be separated form the plane or break apart.

The squadron picked 4 of us to go to Pearl Harbor and fly new planes to Hilo. We flew to Pearl Harbor in a C-47 twin engine plane and landed at Barbers Point NAS Station, and stayed over night. In the morning we were to fly the planes back to Hilo. We had time to spare and went into Honolulu to have some fun. The next morning we went over to Ford Island to look around. There was a new designed corsair parked with a marine standing in front of the plane with a rifle. As soon as we walked up to the plane, the marine said get the fuck out of there. This was one of the new 3000 H.P.Corsairs with 4 banks of 7 cylinders that was just produced. There were only 15 of these built and after the war a few of these were used in the national air races in Cleveland, Ohio. There is one of there planes in the museum at Phoenix, Arizona. After that, we went to the field at Barbers Point and got our 4 brand new F4U-4 corsairs and took off for Hilo. We climbed up to 15,000 feet, just under the oxygen limit and from then on we put the planes in a slight nose down descend and flew to Hilo at about 350 knots all the way. As we were flying, I noticed a hydraulic leak coming from the side of the wing where the landing gear was retracted. This was a typical spot for a hydraulic leak on new planes. This would be the 3rd time this happened to me. I knew by the time we got to Hilo I would not have any hydraulic pressure. There was 2 ways to get the landing gear down. The first was a hand crank inside of the cockpit and I knew that it would take a longtime and many cranks to get the landing gear down. I was not ready for this. The other way was a CO-2 bottle and when you put the landing gear lever in the down position and turned the handle of the C.O. 2 container, the landing gear would come down in a hurry and this was good only once. Just as we were cleared for landing, I used this method. No way was I going to use the crank method.

The Navy told us we were going to evade Japan, and our training changed. No longer would we be doing dive bombing as such, and no longer would we practice rockets as we had been doing. Instead of bombing and rockets from a steep angle, we would be doing skip bombing and rockets from a slight angle and at low altitude. The Navy put up large banners stretched across a beach and close to the water. The banner was about 50 feet high and about 100 feet across and it was quite large. We would break off form our flight, one at a time from about 5000 feet and dive straight down and level off at just above the water and head for the banner at the same level. When we got with in a couple of hundred feet from the banner, we would release the bomb and pull straight up with a slight turn and then we could see where the bomb hit. It was very easy to hit the target. We would do this over and over and this was more fun than any of the other types of bombing because you could tell the speed of your plane easier. And because of this change, the Navy changed the VF fighter squadron form flying hellcats to flying corsairs. The VF squadron always thought the hellcat was better than the corsair, but they changed their minds not long after the switch. We saw those chasing tails at night and other stupid things. If you look into the records you will see that the VF Squadron flew both the hellcats and corsairs.

On the 25th of July, we had two flights of field carrier landing practice at night. I don’t know why as we were not going to make any landing on a carrier at night.

We were notified that our entire air group would be flying to Pearl Harbor and go aboard the USS Antietam for practice as an air group simulating going into combat. The USS Antietam had just been commissioned and was ready to go into combat. We were going to have flights as if we were going into combat. When we started to land on the carrier, we had to take turns and to land 100 planes would take quite a while. It took a long time from Hilo to the carrier 200 miles distance. The flight I was flying in was at the very top of all of the planes and the furthest back. My leader started a cross over and went to close to the planes in front of us and I caught prop wash and it flipped me out of position and I started to lose altitude and every time I lost a few feet, I would hit the lower planes prop wash again and this continued until I was lower than any of the planes. I turned to get away from the planes and gradually got back to my flight and rejoined up. No one noticed what happened and nothing was said. Prop wash could cause a lot of trouble.

When we got close to the carrier, they would clear each flight to come in for their landings. To land 100 planes would take some time and I can’t think of very many wave offs, so we did pretty good. We would spend 7 days on the carrier and each squadron would go on flights of there own. They assigned us quarters and the higher ranks got the best rooms. I was assigned a bunk in the forward part of the ship called the facile bunk room. Again, that is where the lights never went out and there was always a card game going on. You could never get any sleep at any time. The first thing you heard early in the morning was the planes being catapulted and that make a heck of a noise. The carrier would operate all day long. The carrier would do this to practice the things they had to do under flight operations, almost more than the air group needed practice.

We would fly sometimes 2 flights everyday and in the 7 days I made 6 carrier landings. One of the flights I went on was a fighter directory assignment where the ACI department would direct you by radar to the spot they wanted you to go. In this case, they sent a flight of planes out in an undisclosed area, and they sent another flight to intercept them as if you were protecting the carrier. This could be dangerous when one flight started to attack the other group. We make so many turns, it would be really easy to get lost and not know where the carrier was. If the planes turned one way and I another, I would still be out there. They gave us a card with letters arranged in a circle with the center supposed to be the carrier. The carrier would send out signals in Morse code and we would pick the letters up on the radio this way you could find the carrier. This came out late war. Each day you would get a different card with the letters changed. This would be so the Japanese could no find out the system. Some of the early pilots would have loved to have this method as a lot of pilot lost their way and could not find their carrier. I heard that entire flights were lost.

I can’t believe we did not have some kind of accident in the seven days, but we were lucky. The one thing that happened was Ensign James Stills plane caught on fire. I was in the island of the carrier and watched him come in for the landing with smoke trailing back of his plane, but he made it o.k. There was always some sailor taking picture form the island with a large camera and he could take a picture every time he pulled the trigger. They gave Ensign Still a picture of his plane coming in on fire. We returned to Hilo on the 6th of July safely. We continued to fly our 2 or 3 flights a day and on the 15th of August we were told that the Japanese were accepting surrender and the place went wild. Some of the guys were pissed off as they wanted to get to combat and make a name for themselves. Most of the guys were happy as hell that the war was over and wanted to get home. My skipper was upset because he wanted to shoot down a couple more planes and become an ace.

That night we had a party to end all parties. The older guys rounded up a lot of 5th of whiskey and other drinks. They got a waste basket and filled it with bottles of booze and put a pillow in front of the basket. They would fill an old fashion glass full and each pilot would put there knees down on the pillow, make a toast and drink the glass full of whiskey in on gulp. If you wouldn’t do this, they would grab you, force you on the pillow and make you drink it. After a while, they wouldn’t have to force any one. Soon everyone was wasted, including me. Lt. J.G. Daughtry took me to his room, filled a tall glass of whiskey full and I drank it straight down
Okay, here is the very last section of the autobiography in Markdown format.

. A very dumb thing to do, but I was not in a condition to know any better. The last I knew, I was walking down the hall and I passed out standing up and didn’t wake up till the morning. I had thrown up all over the bed and I guess that was a good thing. I remember hitting each side of the walls and was completely blind. My friends told me they took all my clothes off and through me in a cold shower. One of the things I remembered was Lt. Maurice Rogers ‘BUCK ROGERS’, was on the floor and trying to get up on the bed and he was one of the drinkers of the squadron. The next day I lay by the pool and it was sometime before I could navigate. I was not the only one trying to recover.

I flew 12 more flights before the Japanese signed the surrender on the 15th of September, but we still kept on flying. While we were waiting around, the squadron decided to see if they could break the endurance record of a single engine airplane that the marines had set. The squadron picked Lt.J.G Raburn Schneidburg to set the record. They put 3 belly tanks on the plane. The main tank would hold 240 gallons of gas. He took off at 3 in the morning with a full supply of beer. He would fly around the island of Hawaii, staying as close to the shore as possible. Every time we saw the plane go by, you could almost count the revolutions of the prop. I believe he was flying at 1300 hundred R.P.M. and he had the gas mixture turned back as far as was safe. He came down at 5 o’clock in the after noon and they had to help him out of the cockpit and as far as I know, he set the record for that type of plane. 15 hours was a long time to stay up. It would be interesting to find out if this is recorded any where, but I witnessed the event. Finally they told 8 of the oldest and married pilots that they could go home. We had a small party for them and took pictures of the 8. They were loaded on a C-47 for the trip to Pearl Harbor and that started the end of our squadron after training together for 10 months, which is longer, I think, than any other squadron stayed together.

While at Hilo, I flew 13.4 hours in June, 49.2 hours in July, 20.4 hours in August, 16.8 hours in September, and 4.3 hours in October. On Oct 3rd after coming down from a flight and still at the airplane when a friend came out and told me that I was going to be the next one to go home along with Ensign Klein, and Ensign Wise. On Oct 8th, we boarded a C46 for the flight to Pearl Harbor. Looking back, I can’t believe I would not be flying the corsair again. How could I give that up? What happened next would always make me wonder if I could have refused. The reason I accepted was I thought this was also going to happen to the rest of the pilots in the squadron.

## CHAPTER NINETEEN: Homeward Bound on the Magic Carpet

We arrived at Pearl Harbor and they immediately gave us quarters on a base at the very highest point in Pearl Harbor. You could see Ford Island and the whole area where the Japanese bombed. There was not a birth vacant in the whole area. Ships were coming back from over seas loaded with soldiers and sailors coming back from the war. There were so many veterans waiting for a ship that it would be a long time before we would be assigned a ship. Our names were put on a list. Ships were going out to the war area to bring back the sailors and soldiers and this was called the ‘MAGIC CARPET’. It was a sight to behold.

I don’t remember how long we waited, but it was a long time. We got a bright idea to go down to the docks and go aboard some of the ships and see if they could put our names on there list to go home. We went down to Ford Island and started to go aboard the ships, one after another. We would go aboard to the Captains quarters where there was a marine with a rifle standing guard in front of the Captains office. We would ask permission to see the Captain and they always let us see him and we would ask if he had any room for 3 guys wanting to go home. After going aboard a number of ships, we came to the USS Hornet and got permission to see the Captain and asked him the same question. To our surprise he said we sure could and he would have the papers make out. I think this cut our waiting time down by a long ways.

I don’t remember the date, but it must have been at least Oct. 15th. In the mean time out air group was notified that they were going to get the USS Bunker Hill. This was sometime after the war had ended and I could not figure out why this was happening. Maybe they thought it was a good way to get the pilots back to the United States. They went aboard the carrier while I and my 2 buddies were waiting on the hill at Pearl Harbor. If I had known this was going to happen, I would have tried to stay with the air group.

As soon as the air group went aboard the USS Bunker Hill, they started flying missions, which was stupid. Jake Apelbaum told me he didn’t know why they had to fly at this time, when all they were going to do was go home. I saw one of the pilots later on at Ford Island and he told me they had an accident in which Ensign Parker was killed. On this flight, he flew on Lt.J.G Daughtey wing, taking my place. As they were coming into the area to break off for their interval for the landing, Ensign Parker pulled over to get in the right echelon prior to breaking off and he tried to be to hot doggish and pulled up into Lt.J.G. Daughter’s prop which cut his tail off. He turned upside down and went into the water and promptly disappeared. Tex also went into the water, but escaped with a damaged arm. He was picked up and taken back to the carrier. This was the last flight before the carrier was to head home. Only one more landing and Ensign Parker would have been safe to go home.

We finally went aboard the USS Hornet ready to go home. The ship was loaded with veterans from all the combat areas. They gave us a cot on the hanger deck. The hanger deck was cots from one end to the other. As the ship was pulling out of the dock, the full United States band was there playing songs. Just as we were leaving the dock, the band was playing Aloha It was so beautiful, it would bring tears to your eyes After that they started to play, San Francisco, here we come and we were on our way.

The trip would take 5 days and on Sunday, we had to listen to all the church services. The trip home was quite boring, as there were so many veterans on the ship, you could hardly move. The band must have been busy for all of the ships leaving to bring the veterans home. It was sad to be leaving Hawaii after 5 months of being at that beautiful place. As you were leaving, you could see Diamond Head Point to the right of Pearl Harbor. Think how happy the soldiers and sailors were finally going home. I know they had notified there parents or relatives that they were coming home. Tyrone Power, a Marine aviator was suppose to be aboard, but I never saw him. There was too many aboard.

After 5 days and as we were nearing San Francisco Harbor, A large ship with a large all girl band followed us all the way playing beautiful music. Also there was an airship that came down, almost touching the deck, and they were playing music. They followed us all the way into the harbor. Someone should have been taking pictures of this, as it was historic.

It was always exciting watching the docking of the ship. We docked at the Air Station, Alameda. When we docked, there were 3 other carriers docked next to us. The area on the dock was full of relatives who were screaming and making so much noise you could hardly hear. The women were crying and going crazy. The veterans were lined up full force along the railing, just waiting for the order to leave. They were all packed and eager to get off. They lowered the gang plank and gave the order that you could leave. As the veterans were leaving the ship, they gave the salute to the officer of the deck and the flag as fast as I have ever seen, and then running down the gang plank.

I know there is film of the historic USS Hornet docking and some still pictures. I had no one meeting me, but I was going to meet my brother-in-law, Fred Conners in San Francisco. He was in the Air force and stationed at Hamilton Field. My brother-in-law had only one eye. When he was a small boy, another kid shot him in the eye with an arrow causing him to lose sight in that eye. This did not stop him at all. He tried to enlist in all of the services, but they would not take him because of his eye problem. Finally, the Air Force drafted him and I know he was really proud of that. When I finally met him, I had to find a place to stay. The entire city was full of veterans and the city put cots in all of the stores and all you had to do was go into one of the stores and grab a cot.

We were downtown, near the St Francis Hotel and next to the Palace hotel and I said to Fred, lets try the Palace Hotel. I went up to the check in desk and said I would like a room. This I cannot believe as they gave me a room that I had to share with a Captain in the Navy. Maybe because I was an officer is the reason I got the room, but I was happy. We went out on the town that evening, but the bars and lounges were so crowded that you could not get waited on. It was some sight to see all of the sailors and soldiers in the streets. I reported to the Navy department to see about transportation to Great Lakes, Illinois, where I was to be discharged, but there was no hurry. All I had to do was get there. They put my name on a list and it looked like it would be a long time to get my travel orders. You had to wait your turn.

Because Fred was stationed at Hamilton Field, he told me why I don’t try to get you on a flight from Hamilton Field going east. That was o.k. with me and finally he succeeded in getting me a flight that was going to leave the next day. We had to leave right then and had no time to check out of the Palace hotel and get my luggage. Fred said he would take care of that and we went to Hamilton field which was not that far away. Then I got a ride to Mather field not far away where I would get a plane going east. I said goodbye to Fred and when I got to Mather field, I got checked into a room in one of the dorms. As soon as the Air Force flyers saw me, they grabbed me and said we were going into Sacramento to have a good time, which we did. They were pilots of B-29 flying fortresses. The next morning, I boarded a C-47 twin engine plane. I found out we were going to Kansas City, Kansas via New Mexico. I had no clothing and especially not a warm coat. There were no seats in the plane, just some items they were taking to Kansas City. I lie on the floor and put my head on some luggage. It was very cold at the altitude they were flying. The first stop was Albuquerque, New Mexico. When I got out of the plane, it felt like I was in a furnace it was so hot. Soon we were on our way to Kansas.

That was as far as the plane was going east. From there I took train to Great Lakes Naval Station, or boot camp. This is where my brother was sent for boot camp in 1941. I was there a couple of days and they gave me a physical. I don’t know why. If I failed, all they could do was kick me out. I think this is the time you can have an injury verified and get an allotment for the rest of your life. Just before I signed the final papers for discharge, they offered me a chance to stay in the Navy with an increase in rank to Lt.J.G. This is one of the major mistakes I ever made. Given a second chance, I would sign in a minute. The only thing left to do was get on a train and go home which I did. This was the end of a very exciting experience.

## CHAPTER TWENTY: After the War

The Becker Street gang after the war

Gerald Nichols was killed shooting a Jap down while flying off the USS Yorktown, He was awarded the Air Medal and I think for what he did he should have gotten the Navy Cross. January 1945. Ray Yelland flew B-24s and was shot down in the Kurial Islands and managed to survive after spending a week trapped in snow 5 or 6 feet high. He was sent home through the underground and through Russia and was discharged because, if he were taken as a captive, he would be tried as a spy. He was awarded the DFC and the Air Medal. Bill Hart flew C 46s over the hump in China and he survived o.k. Dick Asp was in the navy and got home safe. Robert Taylor did not go into the service. Campbell Spence was in the navy and shortly after he got home, he died of cancer. Skip Mills was a navigator and I don’t think he saw combat. Bob Thompson was sent to San Diego to join an Air Group, but before he had a chance to go into combat, he was killed night flying. He crashed into a mountain, south of San Diego. None of the Skaffs went into the service.

This is the end of story except for making correction Robert Ewen McGaffin Ensign U.S. Navy. This is the first draft and there will be changes and additions later on.

### A Footnote

The United States navy donated an F4U-1D to the National Air and Space Museum in September 1960. Vought delivered this Corsair, Bureau of Aeronautics serial number 50375, to the Navy on April 26, 1944. By October, pilots of VF-10 were flying it but in November, the airplane was transferred to VF-89 at Naval Air Station Atlantic City. It remained there as the squadron moved to Naval Air Station Oceana and NAS Norfolk. During February 1945, the Navy with drew the airplane from active service and transferred it to a pool of surplus aircraft stored at Quantico, Virginia. In 1980, NASM craftsmen restored the F4U-1D in the colors and markings of a Corsair named “Sun Setter,” a fighter assigned to Marine Fighter Squadron VMF-114 when that unit served aboard the USS Essex in July 1944. The plane is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum at Dulles Air Field, Washington This plane was flown by all the pilots in my Air Group 95 while we were stationed at NAS Oceana, Virginia in June of 1944. The number 50375 is listed in my log book. The pictures of this plane called the sun setter shows the plane with number 56 on the fuselage.

In order to become a navy pilot before the war, you must have had a college degree. In 1941 they changed the requirements to 2 years of college. Before 1942 all future pilots took their training at the N.A.S. Pensacola and they stayed there until they were designated a naval aviator. The training took about 12 months and consisted of 5 stages, beginning with bi-planes. The nest stage was flying on the water with float planes. Then the pilots went on to heavier planes and instrument training. After that, they flew heavy flying boats and finally on to airplanes they would fly in combat. This was all done at the N.A.S. Pensacola. There were two other places where cadets trained and graduated as pilot and these were at Miami and Jacksonville, but not too many trained there. Most of the cadets trained at Pensacola. By the end of 1942 there were about 6000 designed naval aviators. From 1942 till the end of the war the system changed by sending the cadets to different fields located all over the United States for each stage and finally to Pensacola or Corpus Christi, Texas, and from there to fields located I n Florida for advanged training in combat airplanes. I tried to tell the story of the training from 1942 to 1945 in order to become Navy Pilots. This type of training only lasted during the war years. In 1942 the requirements were changed to high school graduate and 18 years of age. When these cadets graduated, most of them were only 19 or 20 years of age and were the youngest in the history of Naval Aviation. I just turned 20 when I was designated a Naval Aviator. In the years to come the history of the training for navy pilots in ww11 will be lost. The history at one base will be known, but not the total sequence.

### A Note about Lt J.G Sid Cichy

When Cid returned home, he became a coach at a high school in Fargo, North Dakota. In the next 35 years as a coach he won at least 30 national titles and was enshrined in many coached hall of fame, including the national hall of fame. He passed away in January 2006. Sid was also the teacher of Roger Maris and taught him to play football and baseball.
