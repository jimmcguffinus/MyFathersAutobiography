## Historical Significance

This autobiography provides a unique first-hand account of the accelerated Naval Aviation training program during World War II. In 1942, the Navy changed its pilot requirements from college degree to high school graduate, creating a generation of teenage aviators. McGaffin was among the youngest, receiving his wings at age 20.

The training program evolved from a centralized 12-month course at Pensacola to a distributed system across multiple bases, producing over 6,000 naval aviators by war's end. This document preserves the complete sequence of training across all bases, a historical perspective that might otherwise be lost.
