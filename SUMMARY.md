# The Journey of a Naval Aviator: A Summary of Robert E. McGaffin's Autobiography

This is a summary of the memoirs of Robert E. McGaffin (born McGuffin), who served as a U.S. Navy pilot from 1942 to 1945. His story is a candid, detailed, and humble account of the grueling journey from a teenager in Flint, Michigan, to a carrier-qualified Corsair pilot on the cusp of combat in the Pacific.

## Chapter 1: A Dream of Flight in Flint, Michigan

Robert's dream began in 9th grade, inspired by WWI aviation stories and his friends in the "Becker Street gang." He describes a classic American childhood of street football, makeshift basketball, and teenage mischief. He was a talented tennis player at **Flint Central High School**, graduating in 1942.

The defining moment came on December 7, 1941. While walking to a friend's house, he heard a radio announce the bombing of Pearl Harbor‚Äîa place that meant nothing to him then but would shape the rest of his life.

## Forging a Pilot: The Grueling Training Path

Robert's narrative makes it clear that becoming a pilot was a long, arduous process designed to weed out all but the most capable. He felt much of the early training was unnecessary but persevered through each stage.

### Pre-Flight and Academics (Wooster, Mt. Pleasant, Iowa)
- **Wooster College, OH:** A strictly academic phase added to handle the influx of cadets. He struggled with subjects like engines but was helped by his older, college-educated roommates.
- **Mt. Pleasant, MI:** His first taste of flight in a **J-3 Piper Cub**. His first flight was "slightly tense," but he soon learned from a daredevil instructor, soloing after just 7 hours. This stage mixed flying with tough physical training.
- **University of Iowa:** Pre-flight school was an athletic crucible. He endured brutal physical tests, boxing, and football (where, at 145 lbs, he was made a fullback). The most critical training was swimming, with grueling survival tests that a high percentage of cadets could not pass.

### The Elimination Base: NAS Ottumwa, Iowa
This was the make-or-break stage in the **N2S-3 Stearman bi-plane**.
- **The "Yellow Peril":** He quickly soloed and moved through stages of acrobatics, including loops, slow rolls, and inverted spins.
- **Constant Pressure:** He describes the constant threat of being "washed out," receiving a "down" for a minor infraction that required him to pass two subsequent check rides to stay in the program.
- **A "Dumb Thing":** In a moment of youthful indiscretion, he and his entire class used a cheat sheet to get perfect scores on an aircraft recognition test, a decision he regretted but admitted to honestly.

### The Annapolis of the Air: NAS Pensacola, Florida
Pensacola was the heart of Naval Aviation, where training intensified.
- **SNV Vultee Vibrator:** He learned to fly this more powerful plane, where the noise was so loud it would shake the barracks windows.
- **Instrument Flying:** At Whiting Field, he trained in the SNJ to fly "under the hood," learning the low-frequency range navigation that was the standard of the day. He flunked one check ride for being "lucky" but passed the re-takes.
- **"Bloody Barin":** His final stage was at NAS Barin Field. Here, the training was relentless and dangerous. He practiced gunnery, dive-bombing, and dogfighting against instructors, finally graduating as a fighter pilot.

On **July 28, 1944**, he was officially designated a Naval Aviator, receiving his commission and the coveted Wings of Gold. He was just 20 years old.

## Preparing for Combat: Taming the Corsair

After graduation, Robert was assigned to his dream plane: the **F4U Corsair**.

### NAS Jacksonville, Florida
This was his operational training, flying battle-worn Corsairs.
- **First Solo:** He remembers the sheer power of the 2,000 HP engine and a nerve-wracking landing where a WAVE in the tower made him go around twice because his canopy wasn't open.
- **Constant Danger:** He recounts the constant "Maydays" from engine failures, dangerous night flights (including running out of gas over downtown Jacksonville), and a near-miss with a flat tire on landing.
- **First Loss:** His squadron mate, **Ensign Pete Kantralis**, was killed during a dogfighting exercise. It was a sobering introduction to the deadly seriousness of their work.

### Carrier Qualification: NAS Glenview, Illinois
The final test was to prove he could land on a carrier.
- **USS Wolverine:** He flew out over Lake Michigan to qualify on this converted Great Lakes steamer.
- **A Harrowing Landing:** After a near-disaster on takeoff (one flap down), he made several passes at the carrier. On one landing, he hit the deck on one wheel and skidded to a stop with his plane just **one foot from the edge of the flight deck**. He successfully completed his eight required landings.

## The Final Stretch: VBF-95 in Hilo, Hawaii

As part of **Bombing Fighter Squadron 95 ("Wright's Raiders")**, he spent the final months of the war training relentlessly at NAS Hilo.

- **Intense Training:** The squadron flew 4-5 hours a day, practicing gunnery, rockets (including the massive "Tiny Tims"), and new skip-bombing tactics for the planned invasion of Japan.
- **The Seat Incident:** He experienced his closest brush with death when, on a test flight, his entire seat assembly broke loose and dropped to the bottom of the fuselage. Pinned, unable to see, and with his head below the cockpit sill, he flew the plane back to base purely by instruments, dipping the nose periodically to get a glimpse of the field before making a blind landing.
- **More Losses:** The danger never ceased. He witnessed the deaths of several more squadron mates in training accidents, including **Ensign Orville Thorson** (engine failure over the cold Delaware Bay) and **Ensign Parker** (a fatal collision on final approach to the carrier after the war had ended).

## War's End and Homecoming

The squadron was on the carrier USS Antietam for final exercises when the war ended on August 15, 1945. The news was met with a mix of wild celebration and disappointment from those who wanted to see combat.

Robert was among the first to be sent home, traveling on the USS Hornet as part of the "Magic Carpet" fleet. He describes the emotional scene of docking in San Francisco, filled with cheering families and crying loved ones. After being offered a chance to stay in the Navy‚Äîa decision he would later regret declining‚Äîhe was honorably discharged at Great Lakes, Illinois, and took a train home.

His story is a testament to the courage, skill, and incredible luck it took for a young man to survive the perilous journey of becoming‚Äîand being‚Äîa Naval Aviator in World War II.
