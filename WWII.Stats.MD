# ✈️ Robert E. McGuffin aka Robert E. McGaffin

## 🇺🇸 From a Misspelled Legacy to Aviation Legend

### 📛 The Name That Almost Wasn't  
When Robert E. McGuffin passed his U.S. Navy flight physical on the same day as the Pearl Harbor attack (Dec 7, 1941), he officially began his journey into military aviation. But during the paperwork, a Navy clerk accidentally misspelled his surname as "McGaffin."

When young Robert pointed it out, the clerk replied,  
> "We'd have to send you back in the pool — you'd lose your Corsair."  

Robert didn't hesitate.  
He chose the **Corsair** — and the name "McGaffin" stuck with him for the duration of the war.  
**His flight records, certificates, and awards were all issued under this name.**
